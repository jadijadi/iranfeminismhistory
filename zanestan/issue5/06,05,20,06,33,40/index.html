      <p>This page is devoted to sharing tips on how to effectively deal with street harassment. This includes where to find self-defense classes and how to judge a situation and react appropriately. </p>

<p>We hope to add downloadable posters and flyers soon so check back. Please share any tactics by clicking on contact and sending us an email. </p>

<p>    <br />
BASIC ADVICE*<br />
If you are the victim of harassment, take the following steps:</p>

<p>Be safe<br />
Safety is a priority. If you are in a situation in which you feel unsafe at all, remove yourself from it as quickly as possible. </p>

<p>If you feel safe enough to respond to your harasser, do the following:</p>

<p>1. Name the behaviour<br />
For example, 'Do not slap my bottom. That is harassment' or 'Do not make suggestive remarks to me. That is harassment' or 'Do not comment on my body. That is harassment' or `Do not stare at me. That is harassment'. You can also simply say in a strong voice, 'Don't sexually harass women' or "Stop! that is sexual harassment." </p>

<p>2. Name the perpetrator<br />
'You, the man in the blue pinstriped suit, remove your hand from my breast.' Or `You, the driver of the blue Polo, do not ogle my breasts'</p>

<p>3. Use strong body language<br />
Look the harasser in the eye, speak in a strong, clear voice. </p>

<p>4. Do not apologise or ask a question<br />
Don't say, 'Excuse me...' 'Would you...' 'Do you realise...' 'I'm sorry, but...' 'Please...' </p>

<p>5. Do not get into a dialogue with the harasser<br />
Do not answer any of the harassers questions. Simply repeat your statement or leave. </p>

<p>So, for example,</p>

<p>What you should NOT do:<br />
You say, `Do not shout out, "Nice ones" to me or any other woman. That is harassment'. He says, `Jeez, can't you take a compliment?' Don't say, `Yes, I can take a compliment, but that is not a compliment. That is harassment.' He will then counter with something like, `Well, you're crazy if you take it that way. I meant it as a compliment.' This allows him to justify his behaviour to you, himself and anyone else standing around. </p>

<p>What you should do:<br />
When he says, `Jeez, can't you take a compliment?' Either leave the situation, having made your point, or repeat your statement, `Do not shout out, "Nice ones" to me or any other woman. That is harassment.' If he continues to try to engage you in a dialogue, either leave or keep repeating your statement. </p>

<p>6. Do not swear or lose your temper<br />
For many harassers, the goal is to get a rise out of you, which is why they participate in this kind of behaviour. For them to see you getting angry or upset just encourages them to continue to <br />
harass both you and other people. In addition, if a passer-by hears you shout out, `You f***ing arsehole' when they have seen or heard nothing the harasser has done, they will tend to think <br />
you are the harasser. This, again, benefits the harasser, who can put on a `Can you believe this woman?' look. If you remain calm, it will be clear that you are the person being harassed and <br />
the perpetrator is in the wrong. It will also take away the reward (upsetting you) for their action.</p>

<p><br />
HARASSMENT IS:<br />
any number of acts or comments by people who are not close friends or family members (although sometimes they can make offensive remarks too but they are often easier to challenge). Acts and comments considered harassment: </p>

<p>Ogling<br />
Leering<br />
Staring<br />
Wolf-whistles<br />
Touching<br />
`Hey baby'<br />
'Give us a smile'<br />
`Nice ones'<br />
`I'd like to give you one'<br />
`Hello sexy'<br />
`Cheer up, love, it might never happen' (it just did)<br />
`Oooh, I wouldn't eat that if I were you? too fattening'<br />
`Thunder thighs'</p>
