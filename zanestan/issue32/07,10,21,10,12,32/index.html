      <div dir="ltr">Note: this article appeared in Gendering the Middle East, Deniz Kandiyoti (Editor), Pbulisher: I.B. Tauris, 1996 

<p>Feminism(s)1 in the Middle East and their articulations with Islam have attracted substantial interest in recent years. This chapter will focus on the interaction between feminism and Islam in Iran. It will trace, in general terms, the development of feminism in that country and the ways in which it has interacted with Islam at various historical moments since the turn of the century While in recent decades feminisms in the Arab Middle East by and large make reference to utopian Islam(s) to defend women's rights, in Iran the interaction between feminism and Islam has taken place in the context of a militant Shi’i state which claims to have implemented `true Islam'. The contrast between these contexts may provide a useful contribution to an understanding of the interaction between feminism and Islam in various Middle Eastern contexts.</p>

<p>The approach adopted in this chapter emanates from the view that far from being an optional extra, gender is situated at the heart of political discourses in Iran. Indeed, any political discourse aiming at the social re-organization of Iranian society has necessarily entailed a redefinition of gender relations and of women's position in society. Therefore, this chapter will place the interaction between Islam and feminism in the broader context of political process in twentieth-century Iran.</p>

<p>Early Twentieth-Century Nationalist Feminism</p>

<p>In tracing the historical development of feminism in relation to Islam, a natural starting point would be the constitutional movement of the early twentieth century, since this was the context within which the `woman question' was first explicitly raised in Iran.</p>

<p>The Constitutional Revolution of 1906-11 took place against the background of Western intrusion and the rise of nationalism.''2 It revolved around the demand for constitutional monarchy to curb the power of the monarch in favour of the power of parliament and the rule of law on the one hand, and to protect Iran's national interests in the face of Western economic and political intervention on the other. It rested upon a diverse urban alliance which included merchants, traders, land owners, secular intellectuals and the Shi’i clergy.3 The importance of the constitutional movement for women was in the creation of a particular vision of modern Iran. The concept of modernity encapsulated justice, democracy, independence and women's emancipation. The movement created a conceptual link between national independence and progress and women's emancipation. It constructed women as social actors for the first time and facilitated the formation of a network of women's rights activists which gradually developed into a loosely formed women's movement.4</p>

<p>Since the very idea of women's emancipation was grounded in the need for national progress, women activists prioritized the general developmental gains implicit in the improvement of women's position. The main demands of the women's movement included education and the abolition of practices such as seclusion and early marriage, which were regarded as serious impediments to women's contribution to national development. The way in which women's emancipation became associated with national progress during the constitutional period, .created a generic link between feminism and nationalism which has shaped the course of Iranian feminism ever since. This has had at least two consequences. First, it has made it impossible to talk about the interaction between feminism and Islam without taking into account the links between Islam and nationalism. Second, this has been one of the main reasons why individualistic types of feminism based on women's personal experience and individual choice, a stance commonly associated with feminism in the West, have not developed in Iran.</p>

<p>The type of nationalism that developed in Iran in the first half of the century was on the whole secular. It was constructed as an alternative discourse, as Islam was associated with traditionalism and backwardness. During the constitutional period, secular intellectuals played an important role in constructing concepts such as constitutionalism, nationalism, modernity and women's emancipation. Amongst these intellectuals were Mirza Fath Ali who expressed a deep admiration for pre-Islamic Iran and Dehkhoda who advised women to drive the mollahs out of their lives. Some of these intellectuals were professed atheists such as Akhundzadeh, Christians such as Malkam Khan, or converts to Babism such as Mirza Agha Khan Kermani.5 Babism was of course one of the main indigenous sources of inspiration for women's emancipation at the turn of the centurys6 since one of its female protagonists Tahereh Q,orrat ol-Eyn took off her veil in public and challenged the ulama (Muslim clergy) to debate women's position with her.'7</p>

<p>From the beginning of this century, then, the concept of women's emancipation became grounded in concepts associated with nationalism and modernity and in ideas inspired by pre-Islamic Iran, new religions such as Babism and the influence of the West. However, the debate on women was conducted in a way which avoided outright confrontation with religion. Feminists of this period complained against social conservatism rather than Islam as such. For example, Bibi Khanum Astarabadi argued that `The obstacle to women's emancipation is not Islam but the male interest to preserve his privileges. If men decide to give women freedom, they would bend every rule to find an Islamic justification for it.' 8</p>

<p>Although the secular debate on women avoided outright opposition to Islam, nevertheless the expression of ideas inspired by non-Islamic sources was considered to be a serious threat by many Shi’i clerics. The Shi’i establishment focused on opposing the practical steps taken to emancipate women. For example, the opening of each new school for women was accompanied by a campaign by local mollahs to close it down.9 This is not to say that the clergy were united on the question of women's education - on the contrary Those supporting the Constitution, such as Ayatollah Tabataba.'i, allowed their daughters to attend school, while anti-constitutionalist clerics such as Nuri opposed it and tried to stop it by inciting mob attacks on schools. Sheikh Fazlollah believed that `If we allow girls and handsome boys to go to school, corruption will spread in society like a plague.'10 However, the Shi’i establishment did not make a serious attempt to present an intellectual challenge to, or defence of, women's emancipation. I have not come across any serious or substantial Islamic apologia or Islamic reformist ideas on women in Iran in the early twentieth century, comparable to those of Mohammed Abduh and Q,asim Amin in Egypt at the end of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>So while women's protests against subordination were conducted within an acceptable cultural framework which avoided overt criticism of Islam, the main point of reference for these women was secular nationalism. The secular nature of early twentieth-century feminism was strengthened further in the post-Constitutional period as a result of two particular developments; the rise of socialism and establishment of the Bolshevik state across the border in Russia11 and the emergence of the state as an agent of social reform.</p>

<p>The establishment of a strong socialist state in a neighbouring country and the resulting rise of socialism amongst Iranian intellectuals helped the post-Constitutional women's movement to develop its own independent identity and become more organized and diverse at the same time. In the first half of the century, whenever freedom of expression prevailed, different factions of the movement forged alliances and created support networks with the political parties of their choice. The socialist women's organizations tended to be the most active ones. Many women activists of this period came from either clerical families, such as Sediqeh Dowlatabadi, or from the aristocracy, such as Mohtaram Eskandari. The main issues of the campaign on women included education, veiling, seclusion, child marriage, polygamy and political rights.12</p>

<p>The emergence of the state as an agent of social reform was an even more important development affecting Iranian feminism in the early part of the century The state established by Reza Shah Pahlavi in 1925 had a nationalist outlook and valorized pre-Islamic Iran. It set out to transform Iran from a dependent, backward society to a modern, independent nation-state and as a result the state became the initiator and implementor of social reform and assumed responsibility for the health, welfare and education of the population, at least in rhetoric.13</p>

<p>Statist Feminism and the Rise of Cultural Nationalism in Mid Twentieth-Century Iran</p>

<p>However, in imposing reform on women's position, Reza Shah's state adopted a forceful and centralist approach and ended an era of women's independent activities by creating a state-sponsored women's organization to lead the way on women's emancipation. The measures proclaimed included compulsory unveiling, free education and, potentially, the creation of new employment opportunities. These measures had been demanded by many constitutionalists and feminists since the turn of the century, and by implementing them the state took the initiative on women's issues away from independent socialists, liberal nationalists and feminists.14 With a silent Shi’i establishment, co-opted nationalism a suppressed socialist movement, and a partly co-opted, partly suppressed women's movement, the only voice allowed on behalf of women was that of the state.</p>

<p>The second Pahlavi state, established in 194I after the abdication of Reza Shah in favour of his son, Mohammad Reza Shah, continued the same pattern of modernization, co-option and political suppression. The initial period of constitutional rule under the Shah resulted in the formation of a short-lived liberal nationalist government by Mohammad Mosaddeq who led a coalition of nationalist forces. The nationalist government, however, did not have a specific gender agenda and its half hearted attempt to introduce a new electoral bill which included enfranchisement for women failed. A CIA-sponsored coup in 1953 against Mosaddeq restored the Shah's autocratic rule.15 The post-coup period of 1960s and 1970s witnessed heightened suppression of most autonomous political groupings. But it also resulted in further state initiatives on women's rights. The campaign for political rights conducted by prominent feminists, such as Fatemeh Sayyah, had some success despite substantial opposition by the clergy.</p>

<p>The 1960s and 1970s also saw the growth of cultural nationalism and Islamic modernism.16 This occasioned a shift in the interaction between feminism, nationalism and Islam. The rise of cultural nationalism as a new political force closely associated with Islam resulted in the Shi'i establishment reclaiming lost moral ground on women and family issues as a result of several new developments.</p>

<p>First, on the religious front, after the death in Ig6I of Ayatollah Borujerdi, the highest Shi’i authority of his time, a group of high-ranking clerics shared similar high status and gained their own followers.17 These Ayatollahs, including Khomeini, published and circulated widely their religious opinions on a broad range of issues, including women and the family. These religious views about women's position found political expression in a campaign by an Iranian version of the Muslim Brotherhood in the Ig6os which presented a new fundamentalist defence of the Shi’i shari'a on women.18</p>

<p>Second, on the political front, reformist clerics such as Ayatollah Motahhari and lay religious radicals such as Ali Shari ati articulated new models of Muslim womanhood for Iranian women.</p>

<p>The ideas of Shari ati were adopted by the Mojahedin-e Khalq, who represented the Islamic tendency within the Marxist-Leninist guerrilla movement of the 1960s and 1970s which led a crusade against the Pahlavi state.19</p>

<p>The success of these new Islamic trends in regaining the initiative on women and the family was due to both ideological and political factors. The Pahlavi state's unwillingness to introduce fundamental changes on women's position within the family enabled the Shi’i establishment to regain the initiative fairly easily Both Reza Shah and Mohammad Reza Shah focused their reforms on the civic aspects of women's roles as opposed to the familial ones. Despite tremendous opposition by the Shi’i establishment both Pahlavi regimes pushed forward with women's education, unveiling and de-segregation, while the reforms that they carried out on the family remained relatively limited. Pahlavi reforms did not go beyond a codification of traditional Shi’i law on women and family as part of the Civil Code of 1936, and an attempt to limit arbitrary male power in the family through the introduction of Family Protection Laws in 1967 and 1975. These limitations were due not so much to clerical opposition as to deeper concerns about the wider implications of granting women real power and independence within the family. The Pahlavi regimes opposed women's independence in the family and their independent presence in the public sphere, and this influenced the logic behind state-sponsored women's organizations which made sure that women's lives inside and outside the home remained under the control of male guardians. This strengthened the clergy's ideological hold over matters concerning women and the family, which was translated so effectively into a successful political campaign by the Shi'i movement during the 1970s.</p>

<p>However, the existence of new Shi’i ideas on women would not by itself have affected feminism in Iran if the political developments of the 1970s had not pushed them to the forefront.20 The rise of Shi’ism as a serious modern political movement in the context of anti-Shah politics became a major factor in the adoption of Shi’i ideas on women The revolutionary context provided fertile ground for the first serious confrontation of secular feminisms (such as statist and socialist feminism) by political Islam. For the first time, Islamic activism became a serious political option for Iranian women, and many women from the younger generation who were totally alienated from state feminism took it up. The Pahlavi state's claim to be liberating women was politically untenable; the nationalist opposition was not able to present an alternative gender policy to that of the state and the socialist alternative only attracted a small minority of women. As a result, the campaign on women's issues became the preserve of the Islamic opposition.</p>

<p>The Islamic campaign on women included appeals to reject `Westernization' and the exploitation of women as `sex objects' which was seen as the consequence of Iran's economic and cultural dependence on the West. Instead, women were urged to embrace the new Shi’i model of womanhood which represented `authenticity' and `independence' and emphasized women's dual role as mothers and revolutionaries.21 This found credence with large groups among both religious and secular women because it promised political freedom, economic equality, social justice, cultural integrity and personal fulfilment. It facilitated women's massive participation in the Revolution of 1979.22</p>

<p>The contrast between women's participation in the 1979 Revolution and the earlier Constitutional Revolution could not be sharper, and was rooted in the different interactions between Islam and feminism in each revolutionary period. The 1979 Revolution was the second attempt in this century, apart from the brief Mosaddeq period, to redefine and change existing relations between the state and Western powers with the aim of establishing independence and democracy in Iran. But while the former revolutionary movement aimed to achieve this through emulation of the Western liberal model of society, the latter aimed to achieve it by constructing an `indigenous' and `authentic' Islamic model of society in Iran. Moreover, while the flavour of the first revolutionary discourse was that of a liberal nationalism associated with secularism, the second revolved around a cultural nationalism associated with Islam.</p>

<p>In summary, Iranian feminism was essentially secular until the rise of Shi’i modernism in the Ig7os. It was only then that the new trend of Islamist feminism (gender activism within an Islamic framework) joined other feminisms in Iran.</p>

<p>Islamist Feminism and State Policy in the Islamic Republic</p>

<p>Let us now consider the development of Islamist feminism under the Islamic Republic. After the establishment of the Islamic Republic, the new constitution gave a prominent place to women, defining them as mothers and citizens. It stressed that the establishment of an Islamic nation was dependent on the Islamization of women and constructed the ideal Islamic woman in opposition to Western values on womanhood. The constitution attempted to create harmony between the Islamic family and nation by advocating a set of patriarchal relations to strengthen male control over women in the family on the one hand, and granting women the right to be active citizens on the other.23</p>

<p>The link between nationalism and Islam was crucial in determining the gender policies of the Islamic Republic. After the Islamic Republic settled into a theocracy, nationalism as a mobilizing force was transformed and re-defined. The state attempted this by constructing nationalism as synonymous with antiimperialism on the one hand, and replacing nationalism with Islam as the main mass mobilization force on the other.24 The new alliance between Islam and anti-imperialism, for which historical precedents existed in Iran, constituted the cornerstone of the Islamization policy of the state. The context of revolutionary populism, anti-imperialism, the effects of a war economy and struggle for state power between Islamic factions determined which concepts and ideas on women were defined as `Islamic' and which ones as `un-Islamic'. The result was a significant reversal of the history of clerical opposition to women's participation in politics. For example, the same clerics who had in the 1960s objected to women's enfranchisement on religious grounds were in the 1980s prepared to grant women the right to vote in the name of Islam.</p>

<p>With regard to women's social role, the Islamic Republic formulated policies on women's education, employment and political participation to ensure the continuation of women's mass support. Women's political participation was approved because it legitimized the state's Islamization policies and created an image of popular support and stability internally and internationally These policies, however, were based on the premise that women's presence outside the home had to be accompanied with a process of de-sexualization of male-female interaction to protect the Islamic family and nation from its harmful moral consequences. A number of policies were developed to ensure this.</p>

<p>First, the protection of the family required the strengthening of male privilege through the Islamization of the Iranian household. The Family Protection Law was abolished and the Civil Code of 1936 was reinstated. This meant that the modest safeguards created for women in matters of divorce, marriage, child custody and abortion were all revoked overnight. Second, an extensive policy of gender segregation and compulsory hejab (head cover and loose clothes) for women was implemented. Third, measures were introduced in order to police the integrity of the family These measures became known as the `anti-corruption crusade'<br />
, with a broad definition of corruption covering any social mixing between men and women as well as adultery, homosexuality, consumption of drugs and alcohol, gambling and a whole range of leisure activities.25</p>

<p>Having thus structured the social role of women, the post-revolutionary Islamic state encouraged the development of an Islamic women's movement to counter the threat posed by secular feminism. The spontaneous movement of secular women to defend their rights against the Islamic state was crushed .and secular feminism was driven into exile.26 Like preceding secular regimes, the Islamic state has ensured that the women's movement remained under tight state control. Different factions of the state and the state-sponsored revolutionary organizations attempted to harness women's tremendous mobilization potential by creating platforms for Islamic women activists.</p>

<p>The hard-line factions of the state took control of women's mass mobilization by organizing mass rallies in support of state Islamization and against the secular and Islamic opposition. Women's mass support was also manipulated in relation to two other areas of importance to the survival of the state-elections and the war against Iraq.</p>

<p>While women from the lower classes provided the mass support that the Islamic regime needed, Islamic women leaders became involved in philanthropic, religious, and feminist activities. Many of the state-funded welfare agencies, health and education centres, charities and foundations were run by women. Women who managed such organizations often came from clerical families and were well-connected within the circle of Islamic leadership.</p>

<p>A third category of Islamist women took up feminist activities under the patronage of the moderate factions of the state. The Women's Society of the Islamic Revolution (WSIR) was founded soon after the Revolution by a group of women to preserve and build upon the revolutionary demand for a culturally authentic gender identity The popular, formerly pro-Pahlavi, women's magazine, Z'an-e Ruz (Woman of Today), was taken over by an editorial board of Islamic feminists and transformed into a popular Islamic women's magazine. These women tended to be highly educated, often with doctorates from Western universities, and professionals in various fields. Their activities included not only publishing women's magazines, but also running women's organizations and formulating Islamic policies on women.</p>

<p>During the post-revolutionary transitional period of 179-81, Islamist feminists drew their support from the religious faction of the Provisional Government and later, in some cases, the office of President Banisadr. The same period witnessed the forceful imposition of a hasty Islamization programme by Ayatollah Khomeini. This went against the views of Islamist feminists who wanted instead a long-term, gradualist Islamization programme based on educating women about the values of Islam.</p>

<p>Islamist feminists set out to create a vision of the `ideal Islamic society' and the role of women in it. The idealization of the future Islamic society entailed a critique of the past and the present. The Islamist feminist theory of women's oppression and liberation was constructed in opposition to `traditional Islam'. `True Islam', according to Islamic feminists, transcended the `traditional, deviatory and colonized Islam' in relation to women.27 The failures of traditional Islam were seen as rooted in male-dominated culture and distorted interpretations of Islamic laws.</p>

<p>Ayatollah Khomeini's Islamization measures received coded criticisms from the Islamist feminists. Azam Taleghani and Zahra Rahnavard, two well-known activists, warned the authorities about the negative effects of forcing women to wear hejab. They proposed that the Islamic dress code should not be made specific to women but that both men and women should be required to wear simple and decent clothing which covers the body in a non-arousing, modest fashion.28 On the Islamic Republic's policy of excluding women from the judiciary, Islamic feminists argued that `women's emotionality is not an acceptable ground for their exclusion from passing judgement,' and said that `Muslim women should be able to take their legal problems to female judges as much as possible, just as they take their medical problems to female doctors.'</p>

<p>Despite the enormous enthusiasm of these women and initial expectation that they would make a major contribution to the Islamic Republic's gender policies, Islamist feminists were marginalized by the hard-line factions of the post-revolutionary government. Ayatollah Khomeini's tendency to ignore voices of moderation, together with repressive state policies, resulted in the radicalization of the feminist strand of the Islamist women's movement. During the politically extremist years of 1981-87 the voice of Islamic feminism was thus silenced almost completely.</p>

<p>This took place in the context of a diversity of Islamist opinions, political power struggles, political repression, ideological control, economic stagnation, war and international isolation. These developments affected the ability of the state to establish coherent policies or ensure their effective implementation. Although the general framework of state policies on women was defined by opposition to the Pahlavi regime and `alien Western values', actual policies of Islamization were formulated in a heterogeneous and ad hoc manner by a variety of agents with different and sometimes conflicting interests.29 The way this affected women can be seen in the pattern of their education and employment in this period. Although strongly encouraged in official rhetoric, in reality women's education and employment suffered from contradictory policies, the imposition of gender quotas and support for male dominance, combined with lack of co-ordination between the multiple centres of decision-making and lack of financial resources. Nevertheless, although the opportunities available to women were reduced, Islamization policies and mismanagement did not stop women's participation in education and employment.30</p>

<p>The state also failed to deliver `Islamic justice' in relation to women's position within the family Women had been promised support for their `natural' rights and roles. They were to receive economic and legal protection from the Islamic state and its male representatives in the home. In return, women were expected to prove their credentials as obedient wives, self sacrificing mothers and active citizens.31 However, this equation failed to work in the actual political and economic circumstances of the Islamic Republic. On the contrary, measures such as the strengthening of male authority in the family not only failed to increase women's protection, but actually resulted in the reduction of women's familial rights and the deterioration of their material condition.32 The Islamic Republic may have given its female supporters the opportunity for popular political participation and a sense of righteousness and self worth, but it seriously undermined women's position within the family and restricted their human rights.<br />
All this gave greater credence to the cause of Islamist feminism.</p>

<p>To survive during particularly repressive periods, Islamist feminists tried to be as non-controversial as possible, and in doing so they colluded extensively with state attacks on women's rights. The degree of loyalty to the state expected from Islamist feminists proved to be much higher than that expected from the pro-state feminists of the Pahlavi era, Despite this, the extremist years had a maturing effect on Islamic feminists. They realized that unless they established an autonomous existence and spoke out against state policy, women would continue to get a raw deal despite the state's claim to represent `true Islam'. Thus, a small but vocal Islamist feminist opposition re-established itself in the late 1980s.</p>

<p>Since the late 1980s, Islamist feminists have been able to campaign for women's rights in a much more open and direct manner than before. They have also proved more successful in pressurizing the policy-makers to revise earlier restrictions on women's legal rights and to consider positive proposals for greater rights for women within an Islamic framework. The issues on which they have campaigned have included family, education, employment, political participation and hejab. On education and employment, which seem to be the most sophisticated and successful issues on which Islamic feminists have campaigned, discriminatory practices towards women have been scrutinized and proposals made for their eradication. One important achievement in this area has been the lifting of restrictions that had been placed on women's entry to technical, scientific and medical fields soon after the Revolution.</p>

<p>Campaigns on the family have focused on improving the balance of power between men and women in the family The emphasis has been put on the concept of `partnership between husband and wife' as opposed to the concept of `male guardianship', which is the basis of the Civil Code. Islamist feminists have protested against the failure of state policy to `facilitate the growth of women's talents and personality', `preserve their rights in the sacred institution of family', `protect the rights of unprotected women' and `remove obstacles in the way of women's participation in economic, social and political activities.33 The policies advocated include state remuneration for housewives and unmarried women, monogamy, automatic custody rights for mothers, protection against divorce without the wife's consent, the right of wives to half the family assets, and women's rights to undertake education, employment or travel without the consent of husbands or other male guardians.</p>

<p>However, despite achieving relative independence for their movement and having some success in persuading policy-makers to extend women's rights, Islamist women leaders have on the whole had limited opportunities to take on decision-making roles and have had a hard time gaining authority or influence in the Islamic polity Only a handful have entered the Islamic parliament or the government. Eleven elections during the first decade of the Islamic Republic have produced in total only six women representatives in parliament, an even more tokenist minority than in the Pahlavi era.</p>

<p>The presence of women in the government has been even more limited. Women are barred from the presidency, and post-revolutionary cabinets have not yet included a woman minister. Women have only been appointed in a consultative capacity and allocated seats in consultative committees set up in the parliament and various ministries. They have also been included in the delegations to international conferences. More recently a woman has been assigned as the adviser to the president of the Republic on women's issues.</p>

<p>Conclusion</p>

<p>This incursion into contemporary Iranian history demonstrates that gender issues have been at the heart of Iranian politics and that they have undergone complex and sometimes paradoxical transformations. This has been nowhere more apparent than under the Islamic Republic. Indeed, the transformation of Islamist feminism from post-Revolutionary idealism to realism and pragmatism of the late 1980s has been remarkable. This being the case it is no longer inconceivable to envisage strategic alliances between Iranian strands of secular and Islamist feminisms on women's rights issues. The frames of reference of the two traditions of gender activism are, of course, very different. Iranian Islamist feminism is theoretically rooted in cultural relativism and politically rooted in anti-imperialism, while the direction taken by Iranian secular feminism in exile in the last decade has been largely universalist, anti-religious and increasingly individualistic.</p>

<p>However, the severity and material reality of the problems faced by Iranian women have reduced the importance of these ideological differences. To illustrate this point, it will be useful to compare the experiences of feminists campaigning to improve family laws in the Pahlavi era with those under the Islamic Republic. It took about forty years for secular feminists of the Pahlavi era to change the family law from the Civil Code of 1936 to the Family Protection Law of 1975. In 1979, it took Ayatollah Khomeini one speech to demolish the Family Protection Law in a single blast; and since then it has taken Islamist feminists over twelve years to build it again bit by bit; the task has yet to be completed.</p>

<p>The same family laws which had been historically presented by the Pahlavi state as part of a process of secularization and which were opposed by the clergy as contrary to Islam and therefore demolished, are now being reinstated under the Islamic Republic. The difference does not seem to be in the Islamist or secular nature of the law but in the political priorities of the era. This has created a potential for co-operation and alliance amongst ideologically diverse feminisms. Old ideological enemies may turn into new political allies when it comes to resisting the onslaughts of male supremacy. Although these alliances may be fraught and fragile, they speak of Iranian women's will to act upon their gender interests.</p>

<p>Notes</p>

<p>1 The term `feminism' will be used in this article in the broadest possible sense to accommodate any type of activism by women focusing on their gender interests within any political or ideological framework. I will refer to a number of different feminisms, such as Islamist feminism, secular feminism, state feminism, socialist feminism. This broad definition of `feminism' is not intended to obscure the ditFerences between `feminism' and `gender activism'. However, this article does not concern itself with the issue of whether or not the women's movements described here were `feminist'. That is why it is justifiable to use `feminism' and `gender activism' synonymously in this particular context in order to emphasize the links between women's movements and political ideologies rather than the nature of women's activism.</p>
