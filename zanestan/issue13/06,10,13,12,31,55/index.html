      <p>REGIONAL - By John Schenk-Five children living among the ruins of Bam city's District 3 tell their stories; the loss and despair an all too common thread...</p>

<p>Zahra, almost 4, looks like a fairy, a mite among the gigantic ruins of Bam city’s district three. She is tiny and appears both physically and emotionally fragile. Little wonder, Zahra has lost all her siblings, her two sisters, 5 and 7, and her brother, 9. The girl and her parents are refugees from Mazar-I-Sharif, Afghanistan. Her father, Mohammad Ali Tajik, 56, said his wife, who was at a distribution during this interview, was the reason he has at least one child left: “Zahra’s mother grabbed her and got her out of the house in time.” About his surviving daughter he said, “She has become quieter.” He wiped the tears from his eyes as he recalled his loss, always holding Zahra near to him as if to protect her.</p>

<p>Abbas Mehrabi, 7, lost his aunt in the 26 December, 2003, earthquake in Bam, Iran. He was 175 kilometers away in Kerman during the quake and returned to the news his aunt, his mother’s sister, died in the disaster. “I lost my aunt and I’m sad. I loved her very much.” His mother, Robabeh Jorjandi, 40, said, “We adults don’t understand life and these things. How can a child understand it?” Abbas is in the first grade and suffers convulsions. Abbas’s sister, Roya Mehrabi, 11, is also profiled.</p>

<p>Roya Mehrabi, 11, (sister of Abbas Mehrabi, 7) lost her aunt in the 26 December, 2003 earthquake in Bam, Iran. She said, “I loved my aunt as much as the world. I don’t know what to do to lessen my pain.” Her cousin, Mohsen Jalalabadi, 21, the son of the dead aunt, said, “I was trapped under a door. On top of the door was a steel beam and on top of that the rubble. I called out for Imam Reza and two of the neighbours came and pulled me out. I lost my mother, father and younger brother who was 18.” (Shia Muslims believe their prophet, Mohammad, appointed his son in law, Ali, to succeed him. Ali was their first imam. Shia Muslims in Iran often call upon the name of one of the line of their imams for help in hard times.) Roya is in the fifth grade.</p>

<p>Masoumeh Shojaee, 12, approached World Vision communicator John Schenk speaking short but clear and well pronounced English sentences. She had a poise that was incongruous with the shattered surroundings of her poor neighbourhood. District 3 in the city of Bam was reduced to sand and rubble by the 26 December, 2003 earthquake. Through an interpreter she explained what happened to her: “I lost my mother. The wall fell on us and I threw myself on my mother to save her. Afterwards, we saw there wasn’t a mark on her body. We think she may have died of fright. Even if I killed myself my mother would not return. So, I have to be brave. We as a family have to be strong and rebuild our house.” Masoumeh is highly intelligent. She is in the sixth grade, the level at which Iranian students are first exposed to English. She wants to be a movie actress, a most unusual thing to hear from a child in Iran. </p>

<p>Masoumeh’s father had a stroke before the quake and both she and her brother, Meysam, 18, recommended World Vision staff not talk to him. Meysam said: “People helped us the first two or three days but after that they ignored us.”</p>

<p>Fatemeh Khakpour, 6, lost her 12-year-old sister with whom she was very close plus two brothers, 15 and 17. The sister was Mahboubeh. (Khak means dust and pour, a common suffix in Persian names, means son of.)</p>

<p>“Mahboubeh took me to school. I miss her very much. My mother tells me to go to university. Who will help me with my lessons now.” Asked what she likes about school, she said, “They teach us poetry at school and I like that very much. My (pre-school) teacher is very nice. “ She wonders what happened to the teacher, especially because the teacher’s daughter is a classmate.</p>

<p>Her mother said about the quake, ”I fell on her. Then, the building fell on us and we were trapped for about half an hour. I lost three of my children.”</p>

<p>Mahboubeh was doing handwriting exercises when we came upon her, the diligent student without a school. She was standing and writing intently, pages and pages of the same exercises as if she took comfort in the repetitiveness.</p>
