      <p>“The history of men's opposition to women’s emancipation is more interesting perhaps than the story of that emancipation itself.” Virginia Woolf </p>

<p>Amma I need to study further said Farah the only girl child hailing from middle class family, who was adamant to continue her study but her mother being conscious of social phenomenon regarding girls marriage issue where most of people (in-laws) prefer to have graduate bride for their son rather than PhDs as daughter-in-law, cause they believe the higher the education the higher would be the demands of girls to maintain her life style according to her education, therefore Farah’s mother sharply denied rather than fighting with the odds of society over this humiliated behaviors towards their daughters. </p>

<p>This is not the only case where girls are restricted to add feather in her cap after acquiring another professional degree. It was well known perception that only rural areas have this kind of attitude towards their girl’s education as they believe after gaining consciousness girls would ask their financial and societal rights. However this is not only the rural scenario in fact urban area is also infected by this phobia as well. </p>

<p>It is a matter of great phenomenon why the richly populated nations are still under silhouette of underdeveloped economies. Although they are rich in natural resources as well as human resources but still deprived of basics of life. Is this lack of awareness or lack of channels that spread awareness? Who is to be blame and who is out of this critical net is difficult to judge. As it is not just a matter of governmental affair but a matter of social cum cultural advancement besides promoting better standard of living. However to bring nations out of poverty pollution, availability of Educational reforms on equitable basis is the only ingredient of success that could bring nations vis-à-vis developed nations. </p>

<p>From practical point of view it is very easy to make plans rather than to activate them. New plans are made to over shadow already existing state of affairs, without contemplating how much efforts and resources are involved in current project. Same is the case of education departments. Since Pakistan’s independence vows were made to make education available in rural and urban civilization. Yet no great significant effect can be seen in this regard. </p>

<p>The million-dollar question is why after engaging from millions to billions of rupees nations haven’t achieved the main target of mass education? Is there any flaw in education planning or in its implementation? Unfortunately among other reasons of backward illiterateness, I believe it is gender-based dichotomy that had slowed down the process of literacy in many nations including Pakistan. According to an unofficial survey most of the rural areas in Pakistan women’s are yet facing hardship just to get them enrolled in schools as changing the centuries old conventional perception in which women’s are made to stay at home and men to seek luxuries and comforts of live is still exercised in many rural areas of Pakistan. </p>

<p>Now under this kind of strange phenomenon it is equally difficult to convey the message of Mohammad Ali Jinnah i.e. “No nation can rise to the height of glory unless your women are side by side with you; we are victims of evil customs. It is a crime against humanity that our women are shut up within the four walls of the houses as prisoners. There is no sanction anywhere for the deplorable condition in which our women have to live." Changing pattern of people’s perception regarding women education require utmost efforts from political to cultural and social front. </p>

<p>In Pakistan gender inequality is not a new chapter to depict in this regard. Women are always regarded as homemakers or specie bound to live in Chadar & Char Dewari, in contrast of men considered as only breadwinner of family. Unfortunately this scenario is not just restricted to the rural areas, though from the past ten years or more women have captured most of the managerial, economical as well as political designations, yet the ratio is that not satisfactory which is required while allocating or evaluating millions of rupees in the education sector. </p>

<p>In urbanized environment where educational access is quite easier as compare to remote areas of Pakistan, thus maintaining family honor comes as prima facie. To ensure the centuries old honor and dignity regarding women’s limitations with in home sphere, their families limits their mobility, places restrictions on their behavior and activities, and permits them only limited access of education so that they do not furnish themselves contrary to their family values. Although on the surface things are quite changed now, more and more women’s are receiving higher education, performing higher tasks of job requirement, institutions are providing up to the mark educational facilities, yet you may come across 2 out of 10 families wrapped in old illogical traditional perception over women education. </p>

<p>Issue of allowing, facilitating and proving education to women in Pakistan, even in the technologically advanced globalization environment is considered as fragile issue of thorough evaluation for most of the rural and urban based families. In rural perspective feudalistic philosophy is pouring negative image in advanced women education like the fear of; what if education particularly women education change the conventional family pattern or lifestyle? What if they asked their optimal rights after acquiring coin of vantage in educational arena? What if women come side by side to men, considered as symbol of sovereignty at home? These are simple but million dollar questions yet to resolved while demanding extreme overturn of conventional thinking of male perception. From urban point of view, social insecurity pressurizes families to allow a restricted educational pattern for women to follow, cause they believe once women get maximum educational that desire practical utilization as well, then to maintain flexible vis-à-vis honorable secure family environment would be difficult to achieve. As they are of the opinion that insecure urban environment may not change so to change or to restrict women with in boundary wall can give more satisfaction as compare to maximum dissatisfaction while allowing women to receive education that later demand good lucrative job to achieve the real spirit of education. Besides the conventional perception, work environment, harassment of women out side home all kind of gross violence and abuse in large work as added deprecation for families while considering girls education or to be sagacious for the future of educational implementation. </p>

<p>Basically the reasons and repercussions involved behind low literacy rate of women somehow adding miseries not just to family life but the surrounding environment as a whole. As we know education bring political, economic, social, cultural, religious as well as environmental consciousness & prosperity. Therefore, family pattern should be adopted in such a way that could provide platform to girl’s education while considering women as persona grata in every advanced level of awareness. What government can do in this regard is facilitate educational institutions, the rest lies in the hands of decision makers, either to take advantage of the provided facility or just take it for granted. However, joint venture to utilize the salient features of women’s educational projects is highly desired such as: • Spread of awareness regarding need of women’s education • Making available the educational cum vocational centers for girls education in rural and urban horizon • Providing funding facilities to already existing girls institutes • Hiring professional & qualitative teaching staff • Ensuring easy & convenient access of education • Reasonable and affordable fee pattern for poverty ridden class of women • Assuring secure cum rhetoric educational environment • Time to time parental counseling for the importance & allowance of advanced education of women • Employing all tools & techniques to draw the attention of rural based conventional families to enroll their girls for obtaining education </p>

<p>Somehow the old conventional cum negative approach towards women education desire urgent change in Pakistan. For how long our social uplifting, educational cum rhetoric environment or economy would be dependent just over male counterparts. Force of any kind no matter social, economical and cultural to keep women away from education is totally inconceivable especially for the underdeveloped economies struggling to stand on its own feet and where equal opportunities are arranged in almost every sector of society just to drag nation out of the colossal poverty and backwardness. The hourly need is to take some positive approach towards inviting, implementing and promoting women’s education. We also must realize this fact that no one from outside will come to support us, for that we have to struggle ourselves to convert negative conventional approach towards girls education in to more positive cum particle approach. </p>

<p>This is high time for the conventional families’ governmental or non-governmental organizations must understand that women’s right are human rights so are their education rights. Therefore, something has to be done to protect the Pakistani women’s educational fate and future. Besides that women themselves are advised to raise their voices against this social injustice, they are the existing part of this universe no matter what color, class and creed they belong to but they possess their basic human rights of life, expression of legal possession and peace at any level and at any cost. In this regard education is must to revive the society. As literacy is the supreme power of eradicating or battled with any injustice. </p>
