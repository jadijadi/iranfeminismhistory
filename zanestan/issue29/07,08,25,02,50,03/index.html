      For us, true speaking is not solely an expression of creative power; it is an act of resistance, a political gesture that challenges politics of domination that would render us nameless and voiceless. As such, it is a courageous act – as such, it represents a threat. To those who wield oppressive power that which is threatening must necessarily be wiped out, annihilated, and silenced. (bell hooks, 1989, p. 8)</p>

<p><strong>      Introduction</strong></p>

<p>      The Iranian women activists in the contemporary Iran have always attempted to pursue their demands and declare their expectations of the society through the pages of small independent newspapers and journals (Khiabani & Sreberny, 2004). They have tried to use the press to challenge “gender constructions and gender relations” and “to call for radical rethinking of law, policy, and the Constitution” regarding women’s rights in Iran (Khiabani & Sreberny, 2004, p.15).</p>

<p>      The debates on the role of Islam and Sharia law on women’s status in Iran, or whether alternative interpretations of Islam can be made in favor of women’s rights, along with other debates such as women’s right to divorce, work, travel, custody of children, and the debates on Islamic veil, stoning, and women’s participation in the job market and politics are among the most prominent debates in Iran’s women’s movement  (Khiabani & Sreberny, 2004). These debates have been developed mostly within the pages of women’s press. Women’s publications became more active during the reform movement (1997-2005) and  Zan (woman), the first ever daily paper devoted to women, was launched in August 1998 (Khiabani & Sreberny, 2004, p.33). However, Zan was banned from publication in April 1999 and only in 2000 more than 20 reformist publications were banned and several journalists were detained and imprisoned. As Khiabani and Sreberny (2004, p. 38) have argued, part of the difficulties facing the women in the press was “no different from those facing all publications at moments when the regime flexed its political muscles.” However, comparing to men, the Iranian women in the media still face huge disadvantages.</p>

<p>      There are few female editors in Iran. Most female reporters are assigned to cover “private” issues and rarely get a chance to cover important stories (Khiabani & Sreberny, 2004, p.37). In a study of twelve prominent newspapers in Iran in 2003, all the editor-in-chiefs, 94 percent of the board of directors, and 70 percent of the editorial boards were men (Mohajeri, 2004). According to a study undertaken by Women’s Issues Independent Research Group in Iran, there are now only six publications in Iran’s print media industry that are exclusively related to women’s issues. Among the six, Zanan magazine is the only one in which 14 percent of its content has a critical approach to women’s issues and discrimination. The rest of the publications have shown either supportive or neutral approaches towards gender discriminations and women’s problems. There are only 70 women working as editors in Iran (including all editorial levels). Women have less participation in decision-making processes in the media, and they are faced with limitations to cover women’s issues in the print media (Shojaee, 2004).</p>

<p>      There have always been women all around the world who fought against discrimination by practicing “activism through journalism” (Rhodes, 1955, p.29). Ida Bell Wells-Barnett (1862- 1931) was one of these women who addressed critical social and political issues such as racism, women’s issues, and underrepresented groups in the media in her writings (Rhodes, 1995). As Rhodes (1995, p.30) has indicated, referring to activists and journalists such as Wells:</p>

<p>      The practice of journalism during this period [the late 19th and early 20th century]  was very different from today’s professional definitions. The emphasis was not on  some vague notion of objectivity, but on using the press to disseminate distinct  ideas and perspectives to a large audience.</p>

<p>      Seventy three years after the death of Wells, on May 20, 2004 Shadi Sadr, Iranian journalist, lawyer, and the founder of the Women in Iran website – one of the first Iranian news websites in Iran – received the Ida B. Wells Award for Bravery in Journalism of Women's eNews 21 Leaders for the 21st Century. In the speech she presented upon receiving her award in New York, Sadr pointed out that Iranian women’s movement has tried to make women aware of the “solution to the problems they suffer from.” She indicated that this awareness could not have happened without the mobilization of women. She also stated that different feminist groups in Iran have started networking with each other in order to achieve their shared goals. She considered the role of the Internet as an important one in reaching the common goals of the Iranian women’s movement, since websites and blogs have made it possible for Iranian women activists outside and inside Iran to connect and communicate with each other (Sadr, 2004).</p>

<p>      Following the huge ban of the Iranian reformist publications which reached the total of 80 by 2004, many journalists and activists started to write on the Internet as an alternative venue of publication (Khiabani & Sreberny, 2004). The Iranian women journalists and activists, as well as women organizations started to use the Internet as an alternative media outlet. Today there are 21 websites dedicated to women’s issues in Iran. The limitations for Iranian women journalists and the limitations for discussing women’s issues in Iran’s print media have been considered as the main motive for the Iranian women journalists to prefer the online media to the print media (Shojaee, 2004).</p>

<p>      The Iranian feminist websites have organized several public protests in the last three years, something that has not been done by the movement since secular feminist activists’ protest against mandatory veil in 1979. However, no scholarly research has studied the impact of the use of ICTs – Information communication technologies such as the Internet, Web, and email – on women’s movement in Iran. Thus, this study will be an introductory attempt to a bigger research project to be undertaken as my thesis, to explore the role of ICTs in women’s movement in Iran, how ICTs have affected the ways the movement participants organize their activities, how effective their use has been in the movement’s success, how the movement’s participants view ICTs, and what role ICTs have had in the formation of a collective identity among the movement’s participants. </p>

<p><strong>      Conceptual Framework</strong></p>

<p>      In order to describe different aspects of the use of Internet as a means of communication by a social movement such as women’s movement in Iran, an interdisciplinary approach will be needed to link different arenas of this phenomenon. Therefore, the theoretical approach of this study will partly linger upon theories related to social movements and communications, and partly on theories related to identity work in social movements (especially women’s movements). To do so, resource mobilization theories that focus on the ways movements employ communication tools, resources, and strategies (specially ICT tools)  to organize, network, and form coalitions to do collective actions will be employed, as well as cultural constructionist approaches that focus on the role of frames and processes of collective identity formation in the movements. Exploring the effect of communication tools on the process of framing and building a collective identity in social movements such as women’s movement is important, since the main target of gender and sexuality movements in general, and women’s movements in particular, is not “an external structure, but identity” (Whittier 1995, p. 22).</p>

<p><strong>Social Movements and ICTs</strong></p>

<p>       Van de Donk et al. (2004) have indicated that social movements’ communication is heavily based on direct interaction among physically present people. They argue that ICTs and particularly the Internet are likely to give more opportunities to social movements to reach new levels in mobilizing, building coalitions, informing, communicating, and campaigning. They theorize that many new social movements are not closely associated or based on relatively “homogeneous” environments bound to particular territories and social locations (Van de Donk et al, 2004, p.5). Some social movements such as environmental movements, women’s movements, and the Global Justice movements have a relatively “heterogeneous” nature, but can “easily” extend beyond national borders (Van de Donk, et al 2004, p.5). Moreover, these new movements are more likely to welcome concepts such as “diversity, decentralization, informality and grassroots democracy rather than unity, centralization, formality, and strong leadership” (Gundelach, 1984 as cited in Van de Donk et al, 2004, p.5 ). Therefore, it is speculated that new social movements are particularly enthusiastic to adopt ICTs, because these new means of communication “fit their ideological and organizational needs” (Van de Donk et al, 2004. p.6).</p>

<p>      According to Toulouse (1998), the Web is different from the existing media in the sense that it challenges the balance of power between the publishers of content and consumers. Other types of media such as newspapers, radio, television, etc. push people towards whatever they present, while the Web pull the users in the sense that they can choose whether to use it or not (Toulouse, 1998, p.4). According to Toulouse, “a new transnational realm of civil society” has emerged out of the World Wide Web: the “cyberspace” (Toulouse, 1998, p.4.) Some of the important aspects of the Web includes: the possibility that the Web may sponsor new understanding of gender, it gives different facilities to political activists, and it challenges the ideas of freedom of speech. In other words, the Web can serve beyond typing texts and sending e-mails; it has also social and political implications. “The Web can also make it possible for those who produce cultural content to bypass marketplaces and the publisher who control them and to present their content to the public directly” (Toulouse, 1998, p.16).</p>

<p>      Even at the time that the Internet was not used by the public and was only utilized in military and academia, scholars suggested that it could become a significant tool for grass roots activists and civil society organizations (Brake, 2005). This new means of communication can be used to “bypass the conventional media goalkeepers” in their strategies to distribute information, and can be used to “coordinate and motivate memberships of globally distributed pressure groups” (Brake, 2005, p. 423).</p>

<p>      Social movements, “unlike most thematically narrow and short-lived political campaigns,” attempt to change a given social (and political) order instead of only trying “to modify an existing law or replace a political leader” (Van de Donk et al, 2004, p.3). In their activities for social change, movements typically, though not exclusively, use “unconventional” means (Van de Donk et al, 2004, p.3). Social movements cannot exist without persistent interactions both internally and with their external reference groups. This indicates “the centrality of communication and, given both the network structure of social movements and their limited financial resources… the attractiveness of using ICTs” (Van de Donk, et al 2004, p.4).</p>

<p>      The approach of mobilization of resources focuses on the organization’s ability to assemble and to use resources. The Internet is a powerful tool to build an organization, to collect money, to assemble information and to employ and mobilize people (Edwards, 2004). In a social movement organization, powerful techniques of communication for mobilizing resources (including money, staff, volunteers, and members) within and between the social movement organizations are very important, to collect and spread information, and to mobilize people for taking action. ICTs can play an important role in this regard, since they can be less expensive than the more conventional communication tools. They can also be effective in organizing “decentralized networks”, so that people connected to the movement be able to present their views more frequently, and “to mobilize a virtual or physical community of activists”  (Van de Donk et al, 2004, pp.8-9).</p>

<p>      Moreover, the Internet can improve the capacity of organizations to maintain networks and relations with the environment, and to coordinate actions. Also, if organizations are online, they can advance their points of view directly to a wide public, “bypassing the traditional media” (Edwards, 2004, p.190).  According to van de Donk et al (2004) interaction with “external reference groups” such as allies, opponents, state authorities, and mass media as well as “the means and channels of communication” of the groups involved are also very important in interacting with these external groups. As means of communication, ICTs are likely to have consequences for the ways in which social movements interact with their environment. For example, ICTs could help a movement to act in a coordinated way, to react to external challenges more quickly, and to be less independent on the mainstream media. Generally, it is expected that ICTs help to shorten the cycle of actions and reactions, and increase the speed of the “diffusion of new ideas, tactics, and arguments” (Van de Donk et al, 2004, p11). Also, ICTs can help social movements to expand the scope of communicating their messages to larger areas, and therefore can facilitate special activities such as collecting signatures, since they can reach people who are not physically residing in a specific location (Van de Donk et al, 2004).</p>

<p>      In a review of Van de Donk et al’s work, Brake (2005) has indicated that a lot has been written by scholars about “the Internet and the public sphere from a macro perspective, but surprisingly little micro or meso-level analysis has been published about how social movements, in particular, are using the internet and how that use may have changed them” (p. 423). He has admitted that Van de Donk et al (2004) attempted to address this issue. However, he has criticized their theoretical framework from some perspectives.</p>

<p>      He has argued that their theoretical analysis is based on the “assumption” that different usages of ICTs, such as the Internet, are due to “the essential enabling properties” of those types of technologies (p.423). He has also argued that their theories “largely fail” to take into account “the resource limitations of many social movements and members and, crucially, the differing ways in which members of social movements may conceive of the internet and its potential utility” (p.424). He has further mentioned that for many social movement organizations - especially those with low internet adoption (for example in “developing countries”) – utilizing ICTs may help “communications between group leaders and with leaders of other groups across the world, but thereby tend to isolate the leadership from the rank-and-file” (p.424).</p>

<p>      Robins (2002) have also addressed this issue from another perspective in a study of African women ICT users. According to Robins (2002, p.246) the Internet and other “high technologies” can provide tools for empowerment, but also “foreshadow” new ways to increase the gaps between rich and poor, women and men, and women of different classes. ICTs may prove to be technologies of freedom, offering women increased access to resources and training, or of intensified domination. Referring to her study of women communication networks in Africa she has indicated (2002, p.246):</p>

<p> …the impact of communication technologies in Africa is one of ambiguity and  contingency. Harcourt (1999) lauds women’s increasing place online as  ‘stretching old boundaries and divides and creating new spaces for women to  network, organize and change the world’. However, she also questions who is  masterminding the initiatives, noting that ‘The world of Microsoft, high finance  and telecommunications business are not the spaces in which women or those  pushing for an alternative agenda easily find a voice’.  </p>

<p><strong>Collective Identity, Framing, and Social Movements</strong></p>

<p>      Social movements have certain perspectives on social problems; they try to spread these “frames”, and to affect “the public agenda.” They try to create and maintain “a collective identity” that directs their aims and strategies. The Internet can function as a new medium to “expose frames and problem definitions” and “as a space to create shared meaning and identities among the membership and the constituency” (Edwards, 2004, p.189).</p>

<p>      Mobilizing beliefs and ideas, and the meanings negotiated in the movements are both carried and produced actively by the movement participants. This interpretive process of meaning-making, which is discursive and takes place in interaction with the individuals within the movement, the observers, and the opponents of the movement, is conceptualized as “framing” in social movements literature (Snow and Benford 1988, Broad, Crawley, and Foley 2004). This process of framing and “the interpretive frameworks that emerge from a group’s struggle to define and realize members’ common interests in opposition to the dominant order” develop a collective consciousness among the participants of a movement, which can lead to the formation of collective identity among the movement’s participants (Taylor & Whittier, 1992, p.114). Collective identity is the “shared definition of a group that drives from members’ common interests, experiences, and solidarity” (Whittier, 1995, p.15)  In the process of constructing a collective identity, as Whittier (p.15) points out:</p>

<p>      …challenging groups adopt labels for themselves (such as “feminist”), draw lines between insiders and outsiders, and develop interpretive frameworks, a political consciousness through which members understand the world. Of course, “collective identities” exist only as far as real people agree upon, enact, argue over, and internalize them; group definitions have no life of their own, and they are constantly changing rather than static.</p>

<p>To form a collective identity and sustain it, movement participants should be actively in relationship and interaction with each other within a network. This interaction has been traditionally taken place through face-to-face encounters. “Now the Internet allows direct interaction through a medium” (Nip 2004, p.236). Whether the Internet-mediated interactions can contribute to the formation of collective identity in social movements, and the role the Internet plays as a space to organize the process of identity building are questions that need further exploration by social movement scholars (Nip 2004).</p>

<p><strong>      Review of Previous Studies </strong></p>

<p>      A few case studies have been undertaken on the use of ICTs by women’s organizations in recent years. One of the most comprehensive researches on this area has been done by Edwards (2004) on the Dutch women’s movement and its physical and virtual organizations. The websites of those organizations were studied to observe the ways in which these websites had developed. In addition, interviews were held with members of the board of organizations, and with other members of staff engaged in the development of the organizations’ internet users. Based on these case studies, Edwards came to the conclusion that:  <br />
 [The] Internet is reshaping the organizational infrastructure of the women’s  movement. The impact is most visible in the movement’s increased capacity for  mobilizing resources. To a lesser extent, there are also effects in the management  of frames. The movement’s internet uses are giving more exposure to  emancipation and gender issues. However, the interactive functions on the  websites of organizations in the physical domain are still in their infancy.  <br />
            (Edwards, 2004, p.200)</p>

<p>      The research showed only few cases of the effect of these websites on the external groups. Finally, the findings showed that active organizations in women’s movement are using ICTs and employing the Internet increasingly. Edward (2004) has suggested that more research is needed to be done, to explore whether the virtual communities will take the place of traditional organizations or will motivate women to join these organizations.</p>

<p>      Pillsbury and Mayer (2005) have studied several NGOs in Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Uganda that have used media, including the Internet, as a part of Women Connect! Project to address sexual and reproductive health challenges facing women and families. They have explored women’s use of the Internet to get updates on HIV, women’s use of the Internet cafés as a learning medium, and the way women have learned to campaign against teen pregnancy. According to Pillsbury and Mayer (2005, p.362), women NGOs “are improving communication skills to bring needed information about women’s health to their communities.”</p>

<p>      Women Connect! was “a 5-year initiative to support the desire of women’s NGOs in developing countries to communicate more effectively about causes they believe are important” (Pillsbury and Mayer 2005, p362). After the Internet came to developing countries “heated debates” on whether internet could be used as an “appropriate” tool for women in developing countries had formed. The critics were arguing that the Internet is a “sophisticated” medium where the developing countries are struggling with poverty. The other main criticism was the issue of “access” (Pillsbury & Mayer, 2005, p362). Women NGOs, however, did not want to be left out and started using the Internet. UN and later other funds helped many of them to overcome the access problem. In their ethnographic case studies, Pillsbury and Mayer (2005) have also explored NGO activists’ arguments about the importance of ICT for the empowerment of women in developing countries.</p>

<p>      The main hypothesis of Women Connect! project was that “only by strengthening a broad range of communication capacities will organizations be able to maximize their impact” (Pillsbury & Mayer, 2005, p366). Through this project, women NGOs learned to use media (print and online) “strategically” to distribute educational information (Pillsbury & Mayer, 2005, p367). One case study of the project in Zambia called The Zambia National Association of Disabled Women (ZNADWO) showed how they used the Internet to get the information they needed, and how they used both print and online media to distribute the information in the community. What was learned from the project, according to Pillsbury and Mayer (2005, p.369) includes:</p>

<p>      There is great demand for up-to-date health information and much interest among</p>

<p>      women’s NGOs in downloading and repackaging women’s health information from the Internet. …Introducing new technology into an organization causes changes that place pressure on systems, relationships, communication, and management styles. …Women’s NGOs engaged in advocacy and outreach should consider implementing a well-researched campaign using multiple forms of media. … It is important to conduct community-based research, including needs assessments and pretests, to be certain that messages are communicating clearly to their intended audiences. … Women’s organizations need to learn to relate effectively with mass-media professionals.</p>

<p>      SiamWEB.org, a Thai website in English, is another case of women’s presence use of ICT to do collective action. Through this case study, Enteen (2005) has explored how participation of Thai women on the Internet has contributed to changing the misrepresentation of Thai women as just beautiful objects of sex, “submissive to western men,” as well as to the changing of misconceptions about “nation, gender, and community formation”. The study includes description of educated Thai women’s participation in discussions with non-Thai people in online forums of the website. While the website has different pages of information about Thailand, including its culture, its main focus is on dialog among the visitors.</p>

<p>      SiamWeb.org works as a medium to protest against the gendered stereotypes about Thai women in the media, and a way for Thai women to reclaim their identity. Enteen (2005, p.462) has argued that the users of this site “deploy the medium available to [them] to address …cross-media depictions and assume the extranational potential of internet communication while recognizing the powerful sway of national images in the global arena.” She has shown how the use of English language by this website has helped the website’s users to extend a transnational dialog with non-Thai people and to form online communities. However, the study has also shown the lack of balance of power between Thai women and non-Thai people (considering all the assumptions and stereotypes existing about Thai women).  It has shown how Thai women try to overcome this imbalance by their contributions. For example, former Miss Thailand contributes “frequently” to the site with essays and pictures that “provide lengthy and detailed counter-hegemonic images of Thai women” (Enteen, 2005, p.469).</p>

<p>       (Enteen, 2005) has also undertaken a content study of the name, photos, essays, feedbacks debates and the language of the website. She has concluded that the concept of “digital divide” is a generalization that focuses on the technical properties of online media, while it ignores the “examination of who is engaged with digital technologies and how participation occurs” (Enteen, 2005, p.478). Quoting Nelson(2001) she has argued “Casting our nets farther and wider allows us to more fully realize the different levels of technical knowledge and innovation that individuals and communities bring to their work, play and creative expression” (Nelson, 2001, as cited in Etneen, 2005, p.478).</p>

<p>      Nip (2004, p.232) has studied the use of ICTs by women’s movement from the perspective of “the identity building capacity of the Internet” in social movements. She has examined a women’s group in Hong Kong, “the Queer Sisters” and its online bulletin board, which is the oldest queer/lesbian group in Hong Kong, working as a human rights organization that fights for the sexual rights of women. Its website (<a href="http://www.qs.org.hk/">http://www.qs.org.hk</a>) was created in 1997 and in 1998 a bulletin board was added to it. Anyone can post a message or reply to a message on the bulletin board without prior registration or approval. It does not have a membership system, is run by volunteers and its meetings that are being held once in every month usually gathers about 20 to 50 people.</p>

<p>      Nip (2004, p.237) based the case study of the Queer Sisters on the following questions: whether the people who were participating in the bulletin board were developing “a collective identity” in their group and if they were, whether this identity had transferred to an “offline organization” and also helped them to affect and mobilize other organizations that were not active on the Internet, and also, whether “the offline organizations” had any role in the “development of a collective identity on the bulletin board” (Nip 2004, 237).</p>

<p>      Nip has used ethnographic methods such as participant observation to do content analysis of all the 603 messages posted on the forum during one year. Later, she put a questionnaire on a website for two months and asked form people on the bulletin board to fill in her questionnaire. After the survey, she interviewed eleven bulletin participants, five Queer Sisters organizers and three volunteers. “Information, relational, tasks, expression, sharing, advice, discussion, management, intrusion, and others” were the ten criteria of her content analysis (Nip 2004, pp.238-239).</p>

<p>      Based on this case study, Nip (2004, p.255) came to the conclusion that the participants on the Queer Sisters bulletin board developed “a sense of solidarity” with the Queer Sisters and shared “a culture of opposition to the dominant order.” However, they did not share the concerns of the Queer Sisters for political action or “queerness” as a value, nor did they build a “collective identity” with the Queer Sisters (Nip, 2004, p.255).</p>

<p>      Based on her findings, Nip (2004) has argued that the lack of shared concerns among the users is because of the way the bulletin board is administered. The forum is open to the public and anyone can access it, so the users who participate might not necessarily share the queer values of the organizers. Also, since the users do not build a collective identity, the Queer Sisters would be part of “subcultural homosexual movement and women’s movement” (Nip, 2004, p.256). She has further argued that subcultural movements have less mobilizing abilities than “instrumental movements” because they are not consisted of participants who share common motivations (Nip, 2004, p.257). So, she concludes that the Queer Sisters’ bulletin board is working more as a place for expression and sharing rather than a place for raising common values. </p>

<p><strong>Iran’s Women’s Movement, Media, and Information Communication Technology</strong></p>

<p>      Through their websites and blogs, Iranian feminist activists have been able to organize three of the most important events of the history of women’s movements in Iran in the past two years. On Sunday June 12, 2005, a coalition of Iranian groups and individuals (approximately 2,000 women) held a gathering in Tehran to protest the violation of women rights as guaranteed by the constitution. The gathering was held in the capital city in front of Tehran University. This gathering was the largest publicly protest held by women since they got together on March 8, 1980 in Tehran to object the compulsory veil (Women in Iran). On March 8, 2006, Approximately 1,000 women gathered in a public park in central Tehran on the occasion of the International Women's Day to emphasize their stance in support of women's human rights and peace. The sit-in, which was organized by independent women's groups and activists, was supposed to be carried out silently, with protesters holding signs reading some of the following statements and slogans: discrimination against women is an abuse of their human rights; women demand their human rights; women oppose any form of forced aggression or war; Iranian women demand peace; injustice means discrimination against women, etc. However, these women have been attacked by the police and had to leave the premises minutes after their gathering started (on the false claim by the police that their gathering did not have an official permit, while such public gatherings do not require an official permit according to Iran’s constitutional law) (Human Rights News).</p>

<p>      On June 12, 2006, as a celebration of June 12, 2005 gathering and as an attempt to make a day a special occasion in the history of Iran’s women’s movement, more than two thousand people gathered in Tehran’s Hafte Tir Square. The gathering was publicized through Web sites, mailing lists, blogs, and cell phones’ text messaging service (Interview with Jelveh Javaheri, one of the organizers of the event). Minutes after the start of the gathering, the security forces that were accompanied by policewomen for the first time started hitting the attendants and more than 70 people were arrested. While no photographer was allowed to take photos, one freelance photographer who went on the roof a building at the square could take several photos of police violence and put them on his blog. He announced that anybody is free to publish the photos, and hundreds of Iranian blogs and Web sites, as well as western media such as BBC and Washington Post used the photos in their stories.1 </p>

<p>      On March 4, 2007, 33 women’s activists gathered in front of the Tehran’s Revolutionary court, where five of the women who organized June 12, 2006 gathering had a court hearing (Human Rights Watch, February 27, 2007). The 33 women gathered there in solidarity with and to support the five women who were being prosecuted. Prior to their gathering, these women published a statement in a blog, expressing their solidarity and protesting the new trend of prosecuting women’s activists. Within hours, tens of emails were being exchanged that were talking about the arrest of all the participants. While the editors of the main feminist Web sites were all among the arrested women, those members who did not participate at the gathering or were living outside of Iran, started an extensive coverage of the arrests that continued for two weeks, until all women were released. This extensive coverage, which was accompanied by immediate translation of the news into English, succeeded in attracting the attention of International human rights organizations such as Amnesty, UN High Commission of Human Rights, as well as international mainstream media such as BBC, AP, Radio Farda, and VOA.2</p>

<p>      Had there not been women’s independent online media, women’s group in Iran could not succeed in informing the public about their gatherings and mobilizing women to participate in these gathering. The trend of public protests and nonviolent resistance of Iranian women have found new shapes through new information technology tools. It seems as if fresh blood has been injected into Iran’s women movement’s veins through the activities of Iranian feminists on the Internet. Iranian feminists are constantly publishing articles about women’s rights, are challenging the state for gendered discriminatory laws, and are covering news about human’s rights violation in Iran. They have formed virtual groups through their blogs and websites, and are constantly networking and interacting with each other.</p>

<p><strong>      Research Questions </strong></p>

<p>      This phenomenon of the widespread use of the Internet by Iran’s women’s movement in recent years raises several questions that can be worthy of exploration from a feminist or communication perspectives. Based on theoretical frameworks that suggest the exploration of the impact of the use of ICTs on mobilizing resources and forming collective identities in social movements, my future study will explore the following questions:</p>

<p>   1. What were the motivations of the founders of the website and what social conditions led to its creation?<br />
   2. How successful has the website been in mobilizing the public to participate in its women’s rights campaigns?<br />
   3. What contributions have the website and the activities related to it had to women’s movement in Iran?<br />
   4. How has the website confronted media censorship, and what were its strategies to cope or lineate with censorship and limitations of freedom of speech in Iran?<br />
   5. How is women’s movement in Iran employing ICTs to set the frames, affect the public agenda, and create and maintain a collective identity (that directs their aims and strategies)?</p>

<p>In the short interviews that I have conducted for the present paper, I have focused on only one general question, i.e. how Iranian feminist activists who use ICTs as part of their activism see the role of the Internet in the women’s movement in Iran.</p>

<p>      <strong>Method </strong></p>

<p>      To answer the above questions, the following women’s websites in Iran will be studied:</p>

<p>   1. Women in Iran (<em>Zanan-e Iran</em>), the first news website for women in Iran: <a href="http://www.womeniniran.net/">www.womeniniran.net</a><br />
   2. Women’s Field  (<em>Meydaan-e Zanan</em>), a website focusing on four specific campaigns (abolish stoning forever, women’s write to enter soccer stadiums, women’s right to pass nationality to their children who have non-Iranian fathers, and equal family initiative), along with one new and temporary campaign to protest the recent trend of state pressure on Iranian women’s rights activists: <a href="http://www.meydaan.org/">www.meydaan.org</a><br />
   3. Herland  (<em>Zanestan</em>), a biweekly feminist e-zine, publishing a variety of analytical articles, critiques, and news stories on the status of women and women’s movement in Iran and around the globe: <a href="http://www.herlandmag.net/">www.herlandmag.net</a><br />
   4. Equality for Change (<em>Taghir baraay-e Baraabari</em>), a website dedicated to a campaign to collect one million signatures to demand reform in gender discriminatory laws in the constitution, and to inform the public about legal gender discrimination: <a href="http://www.we-change.org/">www.we-change.org</a></p>

<p>   The above websites are chosen due to their diversity in frameworks and objectives, the first one with a news approach, the second one concentrating on four specific campaigns, the third one with a more analytical and scholarly approach, and the last one concentrating on one comprehensive campaign. Moreover, these four websites have been the main organizers of women’s public protests in the last three years.</p>

<p>   To undertake these case studies, eight in-depth interviews with the authors and editors of these websites will be taken place. Also, a content analysis of the content published in these websites within a random one-week period will be employed (choosing a random one-week period is only because of time limitation and the impossibility of a content analysis of the whole content of these websites.) Along with that, the content of these websites during a two-week period, from one week before to one week after each protest these websites have organized, will be undertaken.</p>

<p>   The recurrent themes, the issues/frames discussed in these websites during the period of content analysis, the organization of the websites (such as their sitemap, categorization of content and choice of category titles, use of visual and audio effects, and their interactiveness), choice of words in headlines, and content hierarchy (highlights) will be coded and analyzed based on the conceptual framework of the study.</p>

<p>   The research questions will be asked from the interviewees. Also, the result of the content analysis of the websites will be discussed with the interviewees to verify the representation and analysis of the data and/or enhance the understanding of data.  I will conduct the in-depth interviews in the fall 2007, and will write the study in spring 2008.</p>

<p>   For the purpose of the present paper, I carried out eight short email interviews and one in-depth interview through online chatting in Yahoo! Messenger with some members of Iran’s women’s movement who are active on the Internet and run feminist blogs and the above-mentioned Web sites. I sent out the questions to 15 women, but I did not receive replies from seven of them, perhaps because I could not contact them early enough, due to the fact that almost all the women I emailed were among the 33 women who were arrested and jailed on March 4, 2007</p>

<p><strong>   Interviews and Findings</strong></p>

<p>      My central question was about the role of the Internet in Iran’s women’s movement and how the women’s activists who use the Internet as a space for their activism see this role. Many of the answers shared similar points, which can be roughly categorized in the following themes:</p>

<p><strong>Positive Roles</strong></p>

<p>      While the Internet has been used by researchers and academic people for years in Iran, but its use by the public, especially after the technical tools for producing content in Persian was provided, was coincided by strict limitations and censorship imposed on the media, followed by the ban of reformist newspapers. Therefore, in a short period of time, cyberspace substituted the void of print media and turned into the only space to freely read and write and have a dialogue. Although the state later implemented strict censorship through the filtering of the Internet and limiting the user’s access to the Web sites that were against the official policies, still the Internet has remained the only free space for expressing ideas. This was the most significant characteristics of the Internet that encouraged women to use the Internet increasingly, not as a passive audience, but as content producers. (Shadi Sadr, first editor-in-chief of <a href="http://www.womeniniran.net/">www.womeniniran.net</a>, editor-in-chief of <a href="http://www.meydaan.org/">www.meydaan.org</a> and one of the founders of Stop Stoning Campaign.)</p>

<p>Tribune/Voice: The Internet has acted as a tribune for Iranian women to talk out loud; a tribune to have their voice being heard. Even up to the recent years, the Iranian society was not accustomed to hear a woman talking about her personal life in the public. Blogs provided this opportunity for the Iranian women to talk about the everyday realities of their lives, to talk about issues previously considered as taboo, and to find a voice in the community. While all official media outlets, including the print media, are closed to Iran’s women’s movement, the Internet has become the sole source for spreading the news about the movement: “…women were less social in the society and had no chance to voice their opinion, but now weblog has become a safe haven for them to talk about and of themselves. Their lives and their thoughts.” (Parastoo Dokuhaki, in-depth interview.)</p>

<p>      In the early years of the reform movement in Iran (1997-2005) that reformist media flourished and there was a relatively more open environment in the media, some women’s issues could find their space in the print media. However, this space was limited, because the media ownership has been mostly in the hands of men, and patriarchy has not been absent even in the reformist media. Since the ban of about hundred reformist publications at the turn of the century, even those limited spaces in the print media have been lost, and the Internet has become the only source for feminists’ writings.</p>

<p>      For the first time Iranian women could use these new mediums to talk about  issues that their culture had forbidden them to talk about; issues such as sexuality, sexual orientations, violence in the society and the family, and… However, in a short time period after this stage that can be called the stage of “the Internet as a tool to freely discuss women’s issues,” the online media find another function for women. They gradually became platforms for women’s movement activists to not only present their thoughts and communicate their messages, but to mobilize people. This stage that we are still in it can be called the stage of “the Internet as a battle tool.” (Shadi Sadr)</p>

<p>Parastoo Dokuhaki, a feminist journalist who has written for various reformist papers, runs a feminist blog, and has worked for the only print feminist magazine in Iran for 10 years says:</p>

<p>      …All the newspaper owners are men. Almost most of them are patriarchs, old and have patriarchal mindset and are anti feminist. So weblog, or on a broader scale Internet, aside from its other good media qualities, are the only option for publishing women-related news. And it is a much more democratic atmosphere compared to other forms of media. No one will be banned from it because of being female, or black or belonging to a certain order or sect.</p>

<p>Farnaz Seifi, an active feminist blogger and journalist who writes for the feminist e-zine Zanestan (<a href="http://www.herlandmag.info/">www.herlandmag.info</a>) and is one of the organizing members of the one-million signature campaign, also notes the importance of the Internet as an “independent” medium for the women’s movement:</p>

<p>      I think the main function of the Internet for women’s movement is that it became the independent tool of this movement. In my opinion, one of the issues the student movement suffered from was that its main media outlets and communication tools on the movement’s blossom years were the mediums provided to them by political parties (specifically the reformists), that is, reformist newspapers. Then later, when the student movement and the reformists clashed with each other, these mediums were easily taken away from them and the movement entered, if not to say a media-less atmosphere, but an environment with very few media outlets at hand. Therefore, I think the women’s movement, cleverly, defined and created its own mediums which a big part of it was concentrated on the Internet. In this environment of having no official media, the Internet helped women a lot to have their voice being heard. </p>

<p><em>Networking</em>: The Internet has become the main tool for Iran’s women’s movement to network with other members of the movement, to find about their similarities and differences with each other, and to form short term or long term coalitions to do collective action. Since many activists believe that their phone conversations are being eavesdropped by the state, email and online chat have been used by the members as “safe” tools for communication.</p>

<p>      Communication networks can easily spread their information in a large capacity with minimum expense and in a short amount of time, without being held accountable for each piece of news or story. Although “Internet crimes” has been put into attention by the government recently and some have been arrested in recent years, still it is not comparable with the number of arrested journalists who were involved with print media. (Jelveh Javaheri)  </p>

<p><em>Recruiting, mobilizing and Publicizing</em>: Through communicating with young men and women bloggers who would show interest about women’s issues, women’s activists have been able to recruit new members and volunteers for the movement. “It is also a good tool for the women’s movement to recruit members.  For example, women’s movement activists search for blogs of girls and boys who have the potential to become feminists and start networking with them.” (Nasrin Afzali, blogger and writer of <a href="http://www.womeniniran.net/">www.womeniniran.net</a> and <a href="http://www.meydaan.org/">www.meydaan.org</a>). Women’s online media has acted as an information tool to publicize the events, gatherings, and protests of the movement. The invitation to seminars and March 8 (International Women’s Day) celebrations has been mostly undertaken through mailing lists, Web sites, and blogs. The Internet has remained the only source to cover the news of the activists’ arrests and police violence against women in their protests.</p>

<p>      So, women’s movement in Iran has been able to make part of its demand public by the use of the Internet. Although the majority of Internet users belong to the middle class, still it can be claimed that the audience have become more diverse comparing to the just-print era. Also, publicizing the movement’s activities is much easier online.  (Jelveh Javaheri)</p>

<p><em>Crossing the borders</em>:  The communication between Iranian women inside Iran and in the Diaspora was mainly limited to face-to-face interactions of women in their individual trips to and out of Iran in the past. The Internet has provided the opportunity for these women to have a transnational dialogue, to exchange their views, and to exchange information without facing physical and geographical barriers. This transnational communication has led into cases of transnational cooperation and alliances, as well as educational opportunities.</p>

<p>      Another function of the Internet was the communication bridge between Iranian feminists inside and outside the country after years, thanks to the Internet. Before that, the only communication outlet was individuals traveling out of Iran or to Iran and bringing some books and publications with them.  But the Internet crossed the geographical barriers to a great extent and make women closer to each other. This closeness helped everybody to understand their similarities and differences, find members for coalitions, (both short-term and long-term coalitions) that could cooperate with them better. (Farnaz Seifi) </p>

<p><em>Collective identity</em>: The formation of a collective identity has been limited to local face-to-face interactions among feminist activists in the past, but the Internet has provided Iranian feminists with a more global sphere where they can get informed about each others’ activities, form coalitions, mobilize collective action, recognize their similarities and thus form a feminist collective identity.</p>

<p>      I have seen the formation of a sort of collective identity among Iranian feminists inside Iran. This collective identity, which can be called a “feminist” identity, might have existed among various women’s activists in the past. However, since there has been no public display of identities, due to the limitations of the society, censorship of the media, and lack of feminist activists’ access to the media, this collective identity had not been publicized. Perhaps even some of the women’s groups have not been aware of each other’s activities to embrace this collective identity as part of the women’s movement. Or there has not been many ways to communicate and network for collective action. (Katayoun Moghadam, feminist blogger and activist in Diaspora)</p>

<p>      The Internet helped these women’s groups know each other better, network for collective action, and instead of working as separate islands, cooperate and interact with each other on the areas that they shared similarities of the goals and strategies. Even their disagreements and differences that have been highlighted on the Internet have not prevented them from forming the collective identity, since these differences and disagreements have been still part of the feminist discourse that exists in the women’s movement in Iran. Few years ago, we could hardly hear women talking about their feminist identities in public. But thanks to women’s blogs and Web sites, we now often hear women’s voices that talk about their feminist identity.</p>

<p><strong>Shortcoming</strong></p>

<p>      I am sure that others let you know about the positive aspects of it, so I just focus on the negative aspect of it which is the limited pool of the Internet users that causes the women activists in Iran be a sort of detached from the ground reality and closer to the virtual reality that includes the immigrants and the opposition media abroad, etc. (Soheila Vahdati, www.womeniniran.net and www.meydaan.org writer)</p>

<p><em>Access</em>: The lack of access to the Internet among ordinary women around the country was one of the main issues that the interviewees mentioned. Only seven million people out of the 70 million population of Iran have access to the Internet (CIA World Fact Book). While there is no statistics available on the number of women who use the Internet as an information source, it can be estimated that a few percentage of the women in Iran are actually exposed to the news and information feminist media produce on the Web. Even those who do access to the Internet might not be able to access feminist Web sites, since the majority of them have been filtered by the state.</p>

<p>      This [use of the Internet by Iranian women’s activists] might look very progressive at first, however, the fact that just using the  cyberspace would stop us from interacting with masses of people in Iran who still don’t have access to the Internet, make us confess that the Internet, despite all its uses, if becomes the only outlet to communicate with people, or even in its existing form, if it stays the main communication tool, will keep the women’s movement in the limited number of the Internet users and the movement will not enter other layers of the society. (Shadi Sadr)</p>

<p>Jelveh Javaheri, who is the Webmaster of the One-Million Signature campaign’s Web site and one of the main organizers of the campaign, notes also the issue of the lack of access, and offers some solutions:</p>

<p>      But the main problem that we sometimes take for granted is that those women that we can’t reach out usually don’t have access to the Internet, or if they have, they don’t have the ability to use it, specially because of the role English language play in the ability to use the Internet, and the fear of technology that exist among women, specially housewives. In such a condition, women’s activists can overcome this shortcoming through efficient network management, which one example of it can be seen, of course in a weak way, in the one million signature campaign. For example, the members of this campaign try to access people who only have access to the phone through people who have access to the Internet, while they are collecting signatures or recruiting. They also use this method to spread the news and information of the campaign [by passing the information to the people who don’t use the Internet through people who does] and at the same time try to empower them by giving them the information. Of course this is just a starting point and cannot overcome the weakness I mentioned. </p>

<p><em>Conclusion and Discussion </em><br />
 </p>

<p>      Through the brief interviews I conducted with eight Iranian women’s rights activists, it was revealed that these activists believe in the important role of the Internet as a tribune, a networking tool, and a medium for recruitment and mobilization. As Toulouse (1998) and Brake (2005) have noted about the opportunity the Internet provides to bypass controlling publishers and traditional goalkeepers, the Internet has provided these activists with platforms to bypass traditional and patriarchal media ownership and the state control to disseminate information about their movement.  This medium, has been effective in building “decentralized networks” to exchange views, and “to mobilize a virtual or physical community of activists”  (Van de Donk et al, 2004, pp.8-9).</p>

<p>      The opportunity the Internet has provided these activists with, for persistent interactions both internally and with their external reference groups both within the movement and in the public, can be considered a factor to sustain this movement, and thus, as Van de Donk, et al (2004) have mentioned, make the Internet an attractive tool for the movement participants.</p>

<p>      According to the interviewees, the ICTs have been helpful to shorten the cycle of actions and reactions, as for example in the way they have mobilized people to participate in the protests or the efficient use of the Internet to cover the news of the activists’ arrests. It has also increased the speed of the “diffusion of new ideas, tactics, and arguments” (Van de Donk et al, 2004, p11) in the campaigns the Web sites have carried out. Also, ICTs can help social movements to expand the scope of communicating their messages to larger areas, and therefore can facilitate special activities such as collecting signatures, since they can reach people who are not physically residing in a specific location (Van de Donk et al, 2004), for example the Iranian feminists in Diaspora.</p>

<p>      The active relationship and interaction needed for forming and sustaining a collective identity, as Nip (2004) argues was mentioned by few of the interviewees. As Nip has mentioned, this interaction has been traditionally taken place through face-to-face encounters. “Now the Internet allows direct interaction through a medium” (Nip 2004, p.236). The role of the Internet-mediated interactions in the formation of collective identity in the Iranian women’s movement, and the role the Internet plays as a space to organize the process of identity building, as Nip (2004) has also noted generally, are issues that need further exploration (and I will focus on it in more details in my future in-depth interviews.</p>

<p>      The issue of resource limitations that has been raised by several scholars (Brake 2005, Robins 2002) and was mentioned extensively in the interviews is one significant area that needs much more attention from international communication scholars and development communication researchers. While the preliminary interviews by Iranian women activists comply with Van de Donk et al’s (2004) theory that new social movements adopt ICTs due to their heterogeneous and decentralized nature, and while scholars increasingly talk about emerging applications of the ICTs for new social movements, the role of the Internet for social change should not be romanticized. There is still a long way to go and a huge infrastructural change is needed to be made to be able to employ the full potential of the ICTs to provide social change. As Robins (2002, p.246) have mentioned, the Internet and other “high technologies” can provide tools for empowerment, but also “foreshadow” new ways to increase the gaps between rich and poor, women and men, and women of different classes. ICTs may prove to be technologies of freedom, offering women increased access to resources and training, or of intensified domination.  </p>
