      <p> Urgent Action Alert<br />
Maquila Solidarity Network<br />
April 18, 2006</p>

<p><br />
MSN is sending you this Urgent Action Alert at the request of the Hermosa<br />
workers and the European Clean Clothes Campaign (CCC). Workers at the<br />
Hermosa garment factory in San Salvador, El Salvador, need our solidarity.<br />
Their factory closed in May of last year, leaving 190 workers jobless, and<br />
without payment of outstanding wages and severance pay. Almost a year<br />
later, the situation remains unchanged.</p>

<p>The announcement that the factory was being closed came shortly after the<br />
workers won the legal registration of a union. Prior to the factory<br />
closure, the employer also had a long history of worker rights violations,<br />
particularly concerning payment of wages and social security contributions.<br />
After the factory closed, workers also learned that the owner, Mr. Montalvo,<br />
had failed to pay US$353,000 in premiums for the government social security<br />
and pension funds. The debt dates back from 1996.</p>

<p>What do ex-Hermosa workers want?</p>

<p>1. Workers want to be paid their legally owed severance and pension fund<br />
payments, outstanding wages, and payment for overtime worked since 2004.<br />
The workers' legal representatives estimate that the amount due in<br />
outstanding wages and various other payments (excluding pension funds)<br />
amounts to, at minimum, US$127,823.</p>

<p>2. Workers want to be reinstated at the Hermosa factory if and when it is<br />
reopened, as has been promised by factory management, or at the other<br />
nearby factories that produce for some of the same brands.</p>

<p>Workers and the groups supporting them in El Salvador have exhausted all<br />
legal channels to pressure the factory owner and the Salvadorian<br />
authorities to act responsibly. They are now asking their allies to bring<br />
more pressure on the brands that have been sourcing from Hermosa over the<br />
past years to resolve the case, pay outstanding monies due to the workers,<br />
and ensure that workers are reinstated in other contract facilities. Buyers<br />
at Hermosa have included Adidas, Nike, Russell Athletic, Wal-Mart (White<br />
Stag), Kids Connection, and Speedo.</p>

<p>Please note that a number of the brands have made efforts to encourage the<br />
Salvadoran government to take action to resolve the outstanding issues.<br />
However, their intervention has not resulted in workers receiving the<br />
compensation or job opportunities they deserve. We believe the brands also<br />
have a responsibility to ensure that the workers receive their legal<br />
benefits and employment opportunities in other factories producing for<br />
these companies.</p>

<p>For a short history of and background to the case, and steps taken to date<br />
to engage with the buyers, the factory owner, and the Salvadorian<br />
authorities, visit the CCC website:<br />
www.cleanclothes.org/urgent/06-03-21.htm#his .</p>

<p>*REQUESTED ACTION*</p>

<p>Write a letter to one or all of the brands that have been sourcing from<br />
Hermosa over the past five years. Demand that they do the following:</p>

<p>* Contribute to a fund to cover the workers' legally outstanding wages,<br />
overtime payments and severance pay;<br />
* Take the necessary steps to facilitate the reinstatement of the workers<br />
at the Hermosa factory or at other nearby supply factories they use in El<br />
Salvador; and<br />
* Prevent further retaliation against these workers in the form of<br />
intimidation, blacklisting, or other forms of discrimination in hiring.</p>

<p>Adapt the sample letter below and send it by email to:</p>

<p>Wal-Mart (White Stag): Rob Kusiciel, Rajan Kamalanathan:<br />
Rob.Kusiciel@wal-mart.com Rajan.Kamalanathan@wal-mart.com<br />
Russell Athletic: Ivan Viera: VieraIvan@russellcorp.com<br />
Adidas: Frank Henke: Frank.henke@adidas.de<br />
Reebok: Doug Cahn: Doug.cahn@reebok.com<br />
Nike: Dusty Kidd, Caitlin Morris: Dusty.kidd@nike.com,<br />

<p>*SAMPLE LETTER *</p>

<p>Dear [add name]</p>

<p>I'm writing to express my serious concern regarding the situation of the<br />
workers at the Hermosa factory in El Salvador that in recent years produced<br />
clothes for your company. I have been informed by the Clean Clothes Campaign<br />
(CCC) and the Maquila Solidarity Network (MSN) that these workers lost their<br />
jobs in May 2005, and since then have been campaigning to be reinstated and<br />
to receive their legally due severance pay and outstanding wages.</p>

<p>Obviously, the workers are distressed by their difficult situation and now<br />
face great hardship due to their loss of employment. Many of them are<br />
reportedly being punished for defending their rights and are being<br />
discriminated against when they apply for other employment. It would appear<br />
that they are being blacklisted.</p>

<p>I understand that efforts have been made by a number of buyers to convince<br />
the factory owner and the local governmental authorities to settle the<br />
matter, but that so far these efforts have not been successful. I also<br />
understand that the CCC and other labour rights groups have contacted you<br />
over the past month and asked you to do the following:</p>

<p>* Contribute to a fund to cover the workers' legally outstanding wages,<br />
overtime payments and severance pay;<br />
* Take the necessary steps to either get the factory re-opened, or to get<br />
the workers reinstated at other nearby supply factories used by your<br />
company in El Salvador; and<br />
* Take appropriate action to prevent further retaliation against these<br />
workers, in the form of intimidation, blacklisting, or other forms of<br />
discrimination in hiring.</p>

<p>I am very disappointed to learn that so far no concrete action has been<br />
taken by your company to meet these specific requests.</p>

<p>Reports I have received indicate that the owner of the Hermosa factory has<br />
been violating Salvadoran labour laws, particularly with respect to wages<br />
and social security payments, for a number of years. As well, the factory<br />
was closed shortly after workers achieved the legal recognition of a union,<br />
indicating that their right to freedom of association has also been<br />
violated.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that your company has a code of conduct and a monitoring<br />
program, you failed to identify and address these violations at the time<br />
when the factory was still open. Your company, therefore, must share some<br />
of the responsibility for your supplier's failure to meet these minimum<br />
legal and code standards.</p>

<p>Hermosa workers are now being triply punished: not only did they work for<br />
years in a factory that failed to respect national and international labour<br />
standards, they also lost their jobs because they exercised their<br />
internationally recognized right to organize to improve these conditions,<br />
and they are now being discriminated against when they seek other<br />
employment. Finally, they are being denied their severance pay and<br />
outstanding wages (to which they are legally entitled). Surely the<br />
responsible action on the part of your company would be to meet the<br />
workers' demands outlined above.</p>

<p>Thank you in advance for your prompt reply to my letter. I look forward to<br />
receiving a report on the steps your company is taking to ensure that the<br />
legitimate demands of the Hermosa workers are met without further delay.</p>

<p>Sincerely</p>

<p>*******</p>

<p>Please write your letter today! The Hermosa workers need our support!<br />
