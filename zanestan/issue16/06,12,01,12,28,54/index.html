      <p>The Cycle of Violence, A Non-choice for Women </p>

<p>I was twelve years old when I ran away from home. I spent several hours wandering through the streets of Tehran (back when Tehran was still safe and far less crowded) until I unexpectedly ran into my schoolteacher in Baharestan Square. I became so scared that I caught the nearest double-decker bus and headed straight home, thinking that I would exercise my plan again at a more appropriate time. My absence was not met with any protest or censure back home, and I hadn’t expected that it would. In my family, girls were not allowed to play in the streets but had permission to shop outside for school supplies and books, and to visit friends to lend or borrow things from one another. The only things that would arouse their protest were leaving home without their permission or not returning back on time. I’m not sure why I later abandoned the idea of running away again. I remember the vague feelings of guilt that lingered inside me, and that I had no one to confine in. I don’t know if I would have returned home had my freedom been less restricted. I don’t know if I had run away into the Tehran of today that there would be a chance of returning home at all.    </p>

<p>I was fifteen years old when several of my classmates and I went to a cafe in a Tehran hotel after school. A girl with heavy makeup who was sitting nearby asked me what I did. I replied that I was a student. When I asked her the same question, she replied that she was a tak-paroon, which meant that she periodically worked as a prostitute. Among the four of us, only one of us even knew what that meant. Out of curiosity, we began asking her questions. It turned out that the girl whom she was sitting with was a prostitute as well. She was a bit older, around 18 years old, and was living alone and working out of her home. We had seen street prostitutes before but they looked different- they were generally much older and they did not resemble us at all, and they were certainly not likely to frequent such cafes. Later, as we described this incident to the rest of our classmates at school, we saw the admiration and awe in their eyes. At such a young age, this was a big experience.    </p>

<p>At the time we didn’t know that this was a new phenomenon brought on by rising oil revenues, the development of capitalist relations, and what is politely called the generation gap. None of us ever told our parents and none of us ever went back to that café even though in school, we sometimes bemoaned the fact that we didn’t get their phone numbers.        </p>

<p>Three years ago in a workshop about run away girls and social injuries, I was struck by a statistic that was not cited but that showed that in 1967, the numbers of runaway girls was approximately double that of boys. It was only there at that moment that my old feelings of guilt were discarded and gave way to another: that singular unsuccessful runaway experience was enough to create an everlasting bond between me and all other runaway girls. </p>

<p>During my time, the term runaway girls was not in use, but rather girls were either lost or kidnapped. When they reappeared, we would hear that they had been found and nothing else, no further explanations were forthcoming. And even if the girl lived next door, she would no longer be seen in public, and a little while later, the entire family would pack up and leave the neighborhood.  </p>

<p>I don’t say all this to minimize the patriarchal nature of our society, but rather to explain and situate myself within this discussion. </p>

<p>From this location, when I read in a magazine that “prostitution began re-appearing in the early 1990’s, given the fact that from 1989 to 1997 , privatization and market liberalization began” and I read elsewhere that in 1990, “the Islamic Republic’s first 5-Year Plan went into effect in a vain similar to other structural adjustment programs throughout the world,”  I think of the other change I witnessed during my youth and of the unique forms of domestic and social violence that women experience.</p>

<p>In reality, public discussions in the Iranian media about women’s issues have gradually been growing only within the past 11 or 12 years. In the beginning, they were only visible in the crime sections of the newspapers. And then only as victims, victims of various kinds of domestic violence: physical, sexual, psychological, rarely as the perpetrators of violence. And the women who occupied the news pages were mostly nameless and in the margins of society.  </p>

<p>In a short period of time, two studies were conducted: one evaluated a year’s worth of crime news in Iran newspaper, which is affiliated with the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA), and another focused on news that was covered murder, self-immolation, imprisonment and abuse of women in the household, both of which resulted in similar finds. </p>

<p>We can learn from the finds that conferences and studies about violence against women and gender violence make. </p>

<p>The majority of them share a point that is more or less similar to other places: firstly, most instances of domestic violence are not reported. If they are reported, at the police station, state-appointed doctor’s office, treatment centers, and other organizations, they are not reported as such and are therefore, undocumented and not calculated in the statistics. Secondly, domestic violence is usually hidden and not witnessed by anyone besides the children, and according to Iranian law, their testimonies are not legally admissible as evidence. Thirdly, victims of violence, for reasons of fear and economic dependence often favor secrecy and do not publicly protest until they are at the breaking point of their tolerance. </p>

<p>In all of these instances, the standards for measuring violence are determined by the victim’s perception of it (Shahla Ezazi, 1380). While she recognizes the existence of violence, she is silent because she sees it as inevitable. </p>

<p>All of the studies that seek solutions to the problem of violence against women reach similar conclusions and each in turn, have a hand in exposing the violence. Through such work, they show society’s ability to change and end the cycle of violence.</p>

<p>Apart from this issue, upon closer investigation, major differences between them appear. In the first instances, “Women refer to the appropriate organizations – except under extreme circumstances – for reasons other than spousal violence” (Ezazi, 1380, p. 69). Conducted interviews reveal that a significant percentage accept violence as a reality of domestic life, but as the issue is increasingly addressed on a social level, the level of social participation and changes in outlook among victims occur. It is as if women have woken up from a nightmare and feel their awareness increasing as they try to make sense of their situation. </p>

<p>This may be a bit confusing, but it is not wholly unexpected. It becomes so when the victims resort to extreme actions, such as husband-killing. The latest published statistics are from a study of 15 provinces that showed that 80% of women who killed their husbands were homemakers. In provinces where the opportunities for divorce and re-marriage existed, the rate of husband-killing was lower. Additionally, the number of women and men charged with or convicted of killing their spouses were equal and more disturbing, 82% of  divorces in the 1990’s were filed by women.     </p>

<p>It seems that recently, changes have occurred at least in some areas of Iran and they are confirmed by the latest studies about violence and women’s reactions to it. </p>

<p>I, myself was in a discussion workshop about violence against women that was held by the Women’s Cultural Center this past March 7, and the results were surprising. </p>

<p>The Center’s members conducted 20 preliminary interviews of women friends and acquaintances, from ages 35 to 55, in the summer of 2002 as a preliminary to the workshop. Of these middle-class women who were residents of Tehran, 19 women- including four whom had been physically abused by their husbands- were very sensitive to the different forms of violence and believed that “violence can occur with one look. ” Yet because of the existing Islamic family laws that grants men the automatic right to divorce women, the absolute guardianship of children, the right to enter into several temporary and permanent marriages, and the lack of any pro-women and pro-children laws concerning rape, abuse, and self-defense, the women preferred living with their husbands under any condition over separation. </p>

<p>Five months later in the discussion workshop, the participants were divided into three groups of 25 participants. The participants, who were from different social and age categories, discussed violence and attempted to find solutions. They concluded that women must strengthen themselves by increasing their capabilities, working collectively, finding methods of resistance, and working to eliminate anti-women sentiments in their own surroundings; distance themselves from agents of violence and work towards establishing self-sufficiency; and become more creative in exposing violence. </p>

<p>Implicit in their discussions was the conclusion that if the control of women was acceptable because of their femininity, then they would strive to make feminine resistance and opposition acceptable instead. <br />
My intention is not to oversimplify existing conditions, but the fact that this experience was different from past ones leads me to conclude that a new resistance is forming.    </p>

<p>My reasoning is that women’s victimization is a result of cultural structures, attitudes, and traditions and that in a patriarchal society, where masculine mentality dominates the laws and social mores, their victimization will persist into the domestic sphere as well.</p>

<p>In such a society, whether a man is completely dominant within the household or not, he is considered the symbol and representative of power. And when the mask of benevolence is made of the same material as the mask of power, he is immune to all criticisms. And when the majority of women have lived under such male dominance, envisioning alternative modes of working and living become practically impossible. Consequently, they do not protest and are silent despite their feelings of responsibility and shame towards the bad behaviors of their fathers, husbands, and other members of the family. However, if the mask of benevolence is removed for whatever reason, there remains no pretense for concealment, and other kinds of relationships start to appear in the horizon of possibilities for women who are now distanced from the family. Under conditions where repression continues, this desire evokes a variety of reactions, all of which can be named resistance.       </p>

<p>However, for women’s resistance - in all its variations - to be understood as resistance in a patriarchal society, it must have clear outlines. This includes a vision of self that is accompanied by a new message. As a human being, her vulnerability should be shown without compromise. And if she does not fit the ideal Muslim woman, meaning a good submissive woman, she can not be manipulative either. And incidentally, she must also not be a Western-import.</p>

<p>Among all the different groups of abused women, runaway girls maybe the best group to convey the new message. They rebel in the face of great victimization and intense control and repression. They reject men and the family as their representatives and are seeking identities within a new context and are looking for alternative kinds of interactions and relations. Despite how they are described in society, they give life to a new conception of woman and render meaningless old definitions of women as either good/submissive or bad/cunning. Because of their subversive role within society, they may be the best transmitters.   </p>

<p>Unfortunately, we have no precise statistics about runaways or any other women victims of violence. But there have been some published statistics, including one from a study of 50 runaway girls that found that 74% of them were single, 2% were married, 24% were being exploited and taken advantage of, and half of them had run away at least once before. </p>

<p>Here “single” means not having had prior sexual relations with a man and being a virgin. The high number of single runaway girls point to their vulnerability in the face of sexual assaults. Yet their running away has other, non-sexual implications and significance. It has the potential of rupturing the dominant sexualized conceptions of women.  </p>

<p>The minimum age of runaways in Tehran being 9 years old , in Kurdestan 12 , the sheer number prostitutes , the high rates of self-burning in some provinces , and husband-killings in other provinces, runaways in Khorasan and Tehran, and honor-killings in Khusestan are all factors in effecting this rupture.   </p>

<p>The role of these exposers of violence is important in another sense: the changing tone of the media, officials, and those directly involved. This change of tone becomes apparent when we look at newspapers and magazine articles of the past five years. Although these articles are by and large ideological in their language, they allow women to raise their voices against and react to violence imposed on them, which lead to greater self-confidence.</p>

<p>A high-circulation newspaper  calls the self-burning of young women a protest against family members. The public relations head of an organization that makes it its business to call for and enforce social moral fortitude (Setad-e Amr-e be Ma’ruf va Nahi-ye az Monkar) asks everyone to see “runaway girls as their children.”  We read elsewhere that, “runaway girls consider their actions a form of protest; they see themselves as victims of unhealthy relationships within the family and believe that society has forgotten them.” </p>

<p>This new tone gradually becomes so bold that, to a limited degree, begins defending girls who sell their bodies.  It is also said that one effective way to reduce prostitution is through a “change in men’s attitudes toward women” (Hamid Moqaddasfard, 2002). </p>

<p>But it is not only men’s attitudes that need changing. A change in the overall outlook, a change in policies and in laws concerning women are also necessary. And in the first two instances change is already taking place.  Such changes in tone and policy can help grassroots, and other organizations that deal with the issue of violence, make their case more candidly.</p>

<p>Now we can say and write that “street women and men must have health certificates to prevent the spread of venereal diseases and AIDS.”  Five years ago, such a statement would have been impossible to write or say publicly.</p>

<p>Again, it seems to me that the major cause of this change in tone is the runaway girls themselves, coupled with the critical statistics about street women, women’s self-burning, or even husband-killings that lay bare the nature of their oppressive situation. But it is the runaway girls who are most responsible for this change in perception (despite the inclination of some media and individuals ) by their refusal to be scapegoated. In addition, these runaway girls have not only brought boldness, but a sense of solidarity among us women. </p>

<p>Much like other social groups who are victims of violence and deprivation, these girls refuse to appeal to governmental organizations. And when they are arrested by law enforcement, when they are in court and in reformatories or social service agencies, they speak out loud about the brother who beat them to near death for borrowing a worn-out dress from a friend, about their confinement in a basement for having been seen talking to a stranger, about their injuries from thrown out a window for walking with a boy in a park, or about being sold to friends of their fathers or husbands in return for a drug fix.  They show that, according to a runaway girl, “others are responsible for our sullied records,” and that those others have a “greater share” in the “wounding of our hearts and souls.” </p>

<p>We are not, of course, speaking of a favorable situation. Even though these women have been instrumental in raising awareness about reclaiming the rights of women, their situation is not only dire, they have been given no opportunities to develop other skills. Their exposure to violence has altered society’s understanding of the problem but has done nothing to improve their own situation, as their increasing numbers among adolescents and youth verify.</p>

<p>Based on what has been said above, we can conclude that women exposed to violence in Iran have gone beyond the traditional support networks of friends and family members and are now challenging the prevailing system, with no recourse to protective laws. As such, one can observe changes in social perceptions that unfortunately have not translated into changes at the legal level.</p>

<p>On the one hand, it seems that the government is asking these women to look at their situation from a sociological point of view and to act as their own social counselors; and on the other hand, there are no socially sanctioned roads through which they can move beyond their present situation and collaborate with a growing movement that is demanding an increase in women’s rights.</p>

<p>These women are still in the resistance stage of their struggle. The problem is that in the absence of supportive organizations with legal strength, this inevitable situation may become normalized and take away any possibility of improvement.<br />
