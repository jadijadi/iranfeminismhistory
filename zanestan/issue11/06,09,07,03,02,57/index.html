      <p>. Introduction</p>

<p>   By 1/10/84 (12/20/95), 12556 cases of HIV positive people were registered in Iran. Out of this number, 94.6% were male and 5.4% female.  The estimated number of HIV positive people in Iran is around 100,000.   In this paper I argue that the 5.4% is an underestimation of the women’s share in the epidemic and in the wide gap between the estimated and the registered cases, women comprise a higher proportion. Moreover, I’ll discuss why we should expect the relative feminization of the epidemic in Iran in the coming years.<br />
   Following a brief review of the state of the epidemic in Iran, I will try to explore the gender aspects of it with respect to drug use and sex, the implications of the dominant discourse of sexuality for women’s vulnerability and the significance of marital sex as a risk factor for women. In the last section, I refer to Iranian’s T.V representations of HIV positive women. Finally, I will conclude by proposing some interventions that should be undertaken for curbing the spread of the virus to large populations of women. </p>

<p>    </p>

<p>Women and HIV/AIDS : Patterns of Transmission in Iran </p>

<p>   The HIV epidemic in Iran has been dominantly driven by injection drug use.   Iran has the largest proportion of opioid users in the world (WHO report 2005). The 15 documented HIV positive cases in 1995 increased thirty times just in the course of one year (by 1996) and later rose to more than 12.000 by 2005 (report to UNGASS+5  2006). The available data of the documented cases show that 60% of transmission has been due to drug use, 8% through sexual transmission, 2% via blood products, 0.4% via mother to child transmission and the remaining 30% are unknown (WHO report 2005).<br />
    These patterns of transmission are gendered in various respects. The drug epidemic is more rampant among men than among women. At the same time, however, women's drug use remains more hidden. This is due to a number of factors. On the level of representation, there is a male image of drug use in general and a higher stigma attached to women's drug use. Moreover, the intersection of drug use and prostitution, criminalized and highly stigmatized, is another factor that hinders the disclosure of women’s drug use. As a result, women's drug use is prone to be underestimated and women’s access to facilities that help them protect themselves from diseases, including VCT (voluntary counseling and testing) centers, is limited. Furthermore, the HIV statistics among drug users are mainly based on the information from the VCT centers which are basically targeting men and don’t provide an accurate estimation of women’s drug use. <br />
    Sexual transmission accounts for 8% of the registered HIV cases in Iran. But AIDS experts and researchers in the country believe that the major part of unknown transmission (30%) is sexual transmission.  Moreover, the number of sexually transmitted cases of HIV is rapidly increasing and the share of the sexual route in the HIV transmission is expected to rise in the following years. Since the HIV surveillance in Iran has been focused on drug use, the proportion of sexual transmission should be suspected to be higher in the unregistered HIV positive population.<br />
    Despite the increasing significance of sexual transmission of HIV, the taboo of sex and a culture of silence around sexuality have hindered open discussion of sex and condom use. Based on the official propaganda that premarital sex does not/should not exist, sexual education is absent from the schools’ curricula. There is a dearth of research and data on the sexual dimension of the epidemic and more generally on people’s sexual behaviour. Iran has a very young population. In a study of 1382 (1993) in Tehran 27.7% of young people between 15 to 18 years had a history of sexual contact and 71.7% of them with more than one partner.  The recent HIV/AIDS education in schools (since 1995 for second grade of highschool-16 year olds) emphasizes other routes of transmission, including some rare routes such as iatrogenic transmission, while it only vaguely addresses sexual transmission as “immoral sexual behavior” and “promiscuity”.  Only 11.2% of high schools have trained teachers for HIV/AIDS education(UNGASS+5 report 2006). Even in case of adequate and explicit information and education, the modification of sexual behavior has proven to be a complicated process and a difficult goal to reach. Obscure messages for teenagers - who are much more sexually active than officially acknowledged - at best remain ineffective and at worst convey misinformation. Similarly, the media, which has ignored the epidemic for several years, continues to address the sexual transmission of HIV/AIDS awkwardly. For instance, AIDS experts who are invited on television programs are not yet allowed to use the word condom which is considered too explicit and indecent.<br />
   An extensively debated gendered aspect of the HIV/AIDS epidemic is prostitution. There is no reliable data on the scale of prostitution in Iran. However, almost nobody doubts the growth of sex work in the country.  In addition to the role of severe economic disparities, the drug epidemic in Iran has had an important role in women’s prostitution. The studies on their HIV status, knowledge of AIDS and condom use are sporadic and the available few demonstrate contradicting results. According to one study  in 2002, 24% and another one  in the same year, 83% of women  involved with prostitution in Tehran used condoms. Two limited studies, one carried out in 2005 (149 cases)  and one in 2002 (50 cases) , found that the prevalence of HIV among participating prostitutes was zero. According to other studies, the HIV positive prostitutes were also injecting drugs. Prostitution is criminalized in Iran. Criminalization, added to the high social stigma of prostitution, marginalizes prostitutes; it denies them access to information on safe sex and to sexual health services, limits their power to negotiate condom use, leaves them more vulnerable to violence and increases their risk of contracting STDs including HIV. <br />
   Pre/extramarital sex is also criminalized in Iran. The social stigma of sex out of marriage, fear of legal consequences and unavailability of free reproductive services to unmarried women, discourages these women from seeking health services including HIV testing. Therefore, we should expect a higher number of women who have sex outside marriage among the unregistered HIV positive people. <br />
   Once the HIV epidemic begins to generalize from the previously concentrated state, through heterosexual sex, it rapidly spreads among women.  The percentage of the sexual partners of IDUs, mainly their wives , quadrupled in three years (1991 -1994) among total registered HIV+ cases in Iran.(UNGASS+5 Report, 2006). The great majority of diagnosed HIV positive Iranian women are married monogamous women(WHO report 2005). The predicament of addressing women’s sexual risk in Iran is that on the one hand, women’s sex outside marriage is denied or otherwise demonized by the hegemonic discourse and on the other hand the same discourse depicts marriage as a safe haven and the panacea to all social “vice” and “corruption”. Such ideological construction of marriage added to the perception of AIDS as the disease of the “promiscuous” or “deviant” persons, seriously impedes the addressing of marital transmission of HIV and consequent public health interventions.</p>

<p><br />
 Women, HIV/AIDS and Marriage</p>

<p>  Globally, married women constitute the majority of HIV positive women.  Most of them are monogamous and don’t inject drugs. In the following section, I will look at how the structural factors of women's vulnerability to HIV/AIDS are played out and institutionalized in the context of heterosexual relationships and marriage.<br />
   The literature on gender and HIV/AIDS mainly addresses poverty and gender inequality as determinants of the increasing share of women in the epidemic. Their intersection adds to women's higher biological vulnerability, as the risk of male to female transmission of the virus by sexual intercourse is much higher than the reverse.  The feminization of poverty, considered in part as a notorious consequence of globalization and structural adjustment policies, has apparently put women in a more vulnerable situation, in light of access to information, education, health care, etc.   Moreover, gender inequality further restricts this access in the context of  poverty, as men are usually prioritized with respect to the use of limited resources. Women's power of negotiating with their sex partners/husbands, as well as their ability to protect themselves, is limited by gender inequality and economic dependence on men. Gender norms often do not welcome women's knowledge and assertiveness around sexuality.<br />
   Sexual violence is another factor that increases women’s risk for HIV. Across the world, a large number of women experience domestic violence and unwanted sex within marriage. In many countries, marital rape is not even legally recognized. Sexual coercion often occurs without condom use. Moreover, the social circumstances that lead to HIV exposure such as poverty and drug use, also put women at risk for violence.  Aggressive sexual intercourse increases women’s biological suceptibility to HIV transmission by inflicting physical traumas and causing lacerations. Furthermore, women’s fear of violence significantly hampers their power to negotiate condom use or to refuse sex. The factors that put women at risk of violence are in fact the same that restrict their access to information, education and health care - HIV prevention,treatment of STDs - and aggravate their vulnerability. <br />
   In this respect we should also mention forced early marriages, which are prevalent in many parts of the world. Young girls married to older men lack the knowledge and power to protect themselves, are more economically dependent on their husbands and therefore increasingly vulnerable to contracting STDs.<br />
   Negotiating condom use in the context of marriage or non-casual sex has complicated relational aspects. Many women find it difficult to demand condom use because such a request could suggest that they don’t “trust” their partner’s/husband’s fidelity or could expose the women themselves to the suspicion of infidelity.   This can endanger relationships built on the ideal of love, trust and monogamy; and ideal which is consolidated in the companionate marriage ideal. In many occasions women find the maintenance of the relationship/marriage more important than their sexual health. This companionate ideal frequently commits women to the denial of marital risk, even when there are evidences of the husband’s infidelity.   Often women pretend not to know, out of a concern for the public performance of a successful marriage or because they find this the only way to sustain the relationship and their dignity within it. Condom use would challenge such mechanisms of denial.<br />
   The construction of heterosexual sex is strongly influenced by the hegemonic discourses of the “male sex drive” and the “coital imperative”. The first, assuming men’s loss of control of their sexual behavior once sexually aroused, hinders women form refusing unsafe sex once the sexual act has begun. The latter, demands intercourse as the ultimate goal of any sexual interaction.   In the setting of a sexual encounter, harsh verbal or physical assertiveness is not compatible with the dominant construction of female sexuality and womanhood and therefore not accessible to many women who uphold such self image.   Moreover, threat of violence, fear of jeopardizing the relationship or losing the prospect of love, are other obstacles to women’s assertiveness. <br />
   Romance further complicates this picture. As Warr and others have argued, romance can create a context in which even the need for physical pleasure fades in the attainment of other kinds of pleasure associated with love or “emotional intimacy and warmth”  and where “sex is figurative for an exchange of self” in ways that contradict thinking of sex in terms of health risk.(Rosenthal et al)   Hirsch et al, in their ethnographic study in rural Mexico, report that men’s love for their wives is not necessarily a determinant of their extramarital sexual behaviour and actually  increases their wives’ HIV risk.  When loving their wives, they tend to be more discreet about their sexual infidelity, in order to avoid risking the intimacy with their wives or hurting them. Condom use would betray this silence. This discretion also serves to protect the social respectability of the men and their wives. These researchers find that the social risk (reputation) rules sexual behaviour more than the risk of disease. “Since a man’s social persona affects his family’s reputation, there is likely to be a good deal of silence and resistance to the public discussion of even the possibility of marital HIV transmission” (Hirsch et al). <br />
    Iran is considered a low middle income country and poverty is by no means as extreme as in the most severely AIDS afflicted countries (with a GDP per capita of  $2300 compared with less than $500 in sub-Saharan African countries). However, huge economical disparities exist within the country, leaving large numbers of people in poverty. While women’s age of marriage has increased specially in the urban areas and women’s celibacy is gradually growing in large cities, marriage is almost universal among large parts of the society.  Moreover, in rural areas the average age of marriage remains low. Women’s extramarital sex is severely punished. While the companionate marriage/nuclear family is increasingly dominating the family structure in the middle class urban settings, traditional extended families and arranged marriages still prevail in rural areas and among parts of the urban population. Most women are economically dependent on their husbands. Women’s share of the formal workforce ranges between 10 to 20% .  In legal terms, women don’t enjoy equal status with men, including within family law.  Domestic violence is widespread without serious legal or social consequences for the abuser. Marital rape is not legally recognized and women are expected to obey their husbands by the tamkin law.  <br />
   The tamkin law epitomizes an oppressive sexual order that treats a woman’s body as the property of her male guardians. This is the same ideology that, while not explicitly sanctioning, tolerates or even encourages the cultural practice of honor crimes.  This notion of property equally underlies the obsession with virginity in many Muslim communities. Moreover, as Amado notes, “Islamic law traditionally treats rape not as a crime against God but as theft or violation of property, in this case property of sexual and reproductive value.”   It is important to note that Islam regards property as sacred and Islamic penal code severely punishes theft to the extent of amputation of hand in some countries. Mernissi argues that Islam, unlike Christianity, doesn’t fear or degrade sexuality. It recognizes and values pleasure, and not merely procreation, as the goal of sex. Rather, what it fears and therefore treats it as a symbol of disorder is women’s sexuality.  This ideology constructs women’s sexuality as a threat to public order. It therefore should be controlled and confined to the domestic space or if entering the public (male) space, measures such as sex segregation, veil, severe legal or social punishment for sex out of marriage, maintain the belonging of this reproductive/sexual property to the private/domestic sphere and guard the male ownership. The anxiety over the (sexual) presence of women in public and the possible sexual encounters, is an anxiety over the violation of a certain set of property rights, threatening the existing social relations.<br />
   A symbolic sexual order that asserts men’s right to sexual pleasure and women’s duty to fulfill that right, profoundly influences many men and women’s perceptions of sexuality. During my clinical experience with poor rural women in the west of Iran, I came across frequent examples of women's lack of sexual agency that should be understood in this respect. When I would for instance suggest the avoidance of sexual intercourse for a few days in cases of vaginal/cervical infections, most of the women didn’t even consider that a real possibility. <br />
   Accordingly, family planning programs in Iran mainly target women, promoting oral contraceptives, IUDs and female sterilization. This policy is based on a consideration of birth control as women’s responsibility on the one hand, and a mistrust of men, given the general resistance of men to condom use and vasectomy, on the other. However, condoms, not being promoted by these policies, are still the main preventive measure against STDs including HIV. Condom use demands open negotiation with men and their subscription to it; the power and skill for which many women are lacking.  <br />
   In my practice as a doctor in such a health care system, my strong recommendation of condom use to women, in cases of medical contraindication of hormonal contraception and IUD, was often not welcomed by local health workers, who warned me of putting the woman at risk of unwanted pregnancy which would be even more hazardous to her health. Their concern was correct with respect to the existing culture and practice of condom use and lack of previous education. I should note that birth control policies that focused on hormonal contraception and IUD have proved successful in lowering the fertility rate in this particular socio-cultural context,  while they have left women unprotected against STDs. This is an example of how sometimes strategic accommodation to cultural norms has adverse long-term consequences, despite its success on another front.  Iran has a far reaching, relatively efficient primary health care system. While HIV and even more HBV and HCV have been rapidly spreading in the country in the past decade, the resistance of the health system to accept condom as an effective contraception and to include men in family planning programs, has made it difficult now to promote condom use. </p>

<p><br />
Avoiding Unintended Consequences:</p>

<p>While emphasizing women’s risk of contracting the virus from their husbands, we should be extremely cautious to frame our argument so as to avoid other adverse consequences such as:</p>

<p>1.  Further stigmatization of HIV positive people, the stigma being already high in our societies, by portraying them as corrupt deviants who sleep around and/or inject drugs, infecting their innocent wives. This is neither ethical nor a sound public health strategy. The adverse impact of fear and stigma in addressing issues around sexual health has been extensively elaborated by numerous scholars. Many of these men are among the most marginalized members of the society. The discrimination that follows the stigma, puts them at more risk and restricts their access to services that enable them to protect themselves. It frequently even leads to the denial of health services and criminal legal measures against them, for instance in the case of drug users. Besides, many HIV+ men are the leaders and potential allies in the fight against AIDS.<br />
 This is not to deny that many of these men, like some other groups of men, are abusive husbands or to justify such behaviour. Apart from the general prevalence of wife abuse, particular settings like drug use increase the occurrence of violence. But it is important to clarify that the blame is directed to their abusive behaviour and not their HIV status. Avoiding this confusion is not always an easy task.</p>

<p>   2. Producing the category of “straight AIDS”: innocent women who have done nothing wrong but sleeping with their husbands even when they didn’t want to. This attitude will make it extremely difficult to deal with problems of HIV positive women who are not married and whose sexual or drug use history doesn’t fit the “innocent victim” picture.In my encounters with HIV positive people in Tehran, I observed that this was already gradually happening. The typically tolerated HIV positive woman is the one who has contracted the virus from her drug injecting husband. This further complicates public health interventions and might also demonize other “less innocent” women. We are dealing with social contexts where the dominant discourse assumes that sex is just happening within marriage. While this might be the case in the lives of many women, women’s premarital/extramarital sex and prostitution are far from rare, as mentioned before. Moreover, such an approach suggests a merely protectionist attitude toward married women and fails to empower them in their sexual lives. </p>

<p>Iranian T.V and Representations of Women & AIDS</p>

<p>  In this section, I briefly narrate two television series recently produced in Iran, and both broadcasted in 1384(1995), that deal with women and AIDS. I have selected these two because they engage with women’s sex out of marriage, which is unprecedented in the Iranian T.V. It is notable that Iranian TV is entirely state-run. Throughout these narrations, I’ll try to trace the shift of attitude in television’s account of women’s sexual behaviour. </p>

<p>1. A young female physician finds the receipt of an HIV test in her husband’s pocket. He confesses that a woman with whom he had been involved before his marriage called him and informed him that she had found out that she was positive. The doctor/wife asks him to leave the house for having cheated upon her. Upset and shocked, she protests that by undermining her right to know about his past, he had put her at risk of disease. The husband, feeling miserable, guilty and worried about the possibility of having also infected her, pleads for forgiveness but she rejects him. He leaves home and later his test turns out positive. He travels to the North, drowns himself in the Caspian sea and dies. The doctor tests negative. Meanwhile, the husband’s ex-partner goes to the wife/doctor to ask for an apology for her role in having put her at risk. The doctor, initially very angry, begins to sympathize with her. She is pregnant now and her addict husband puts her under pressure to have an abortion but she wants to keep the baby. One night she escapes from him to the doctor’s house (a very elegant upper class house). The doctor saves her from the husband, and  informs her that she can deliver the baby with a very low risk of transmitting the virus. She takes her to the hospital and puts her on medication. Finally the woman gives birth to an HIV negative baby.<br />
  The new attitude that emerged in this T.V. series was the portraying of a woman engaging in a sexual relation outside marriage, not as corrupt and evil, but worthy of sympathy. Also female solidarity and the disappearance of men/husbands from the scene, instead of the usual jealousy/competition scenario, is notable. At the same time, we should not override the fact that they were not ideal husbands, an HIV positive and a drug addict, nor ignore the clever implicit anti-abortion message. The series did convey the important public health message that pregnant HIV positive women can give birth to negative babies if necessary measures are taken. It also demonstrated that HIV finds its way to “honorable” people’s houses. At the end of the day, however, the ones who test negative are the “innocent”, i.e. the doctor and the baby. The relationship between the doctor and the other woman is very hierarchal, the first being represented as the respectable, well off, benevolent and educated; the latter as miserable, poor, sick, in need of help and pity. </p>

<p>2. The son of a religious family returns to Iran from abroad with his foreign wife. Soon it is revealed that the wife is HIV positive and that the son is aware of this. The family’s initial reactions toward the wife are humiliating, ostracizing and rejecting. They gradually develop sympathy toward her. Finally they take her to a religious pilgrimage (where people go for healing from disease) and she recovers from HIV.<br />
   In this series the familiar disease of “western decadence” is introduced by a western woman. This contrasts with other T.V productions in which it is usually an Iranian guy who contracts the virus  abroad and brings it home. Subsequently the woman is saved by Islam. The story invites to tolerance, conditional on the willingness of the sinning person to return to the path of God. In this case this tolerance is also supported by the emphasized cultural values of hospitality, in particular towards foreigners, and caring for the sick. We can argue that raising the possibility of an Iranian man marrying an HIV positive woman is progressive(!) and challenges the stigma of AIDS in general and women’s AIDS in particular. Moreover, it also carries the message that sero-discordant couples can live together and avoid the sero-conversion of the HIV negative partner. However, the superstitious message of clearing from the virus by pilgrimage and prayer is obviously distorting the already low public knowledge of AIDS.</p>

<p>   Both of these narratives reinforce the representation of AIDS as the disease of the “sinner”. The innocents will not contract it (the doctor and the baby could have well tested positive) or they will recover from it once they repent. This is a misguiding message and from a public health perspective a dangerous one, in a country where most HIV positive women are infected through their husbands.<br />
   Interestingly, AIDS seems to be opening the door of the television scene to the accounts of women’s sex out of marriage. The pattern that unfolds in both of these stories is the tolerance of women’s sexual “indecency” once they are sick, suffering and paying for it with their lives; the indecency that is otherwise intolerable and punished severely.</p>

<p><br />
Conclusion:</p>

<p>  HIV is rapidly spreading in Iran. Although rates are still low and a vigorous campaigning  and appropriate intervention could possibly contain the epidemic, a culture of silence toward sexuality has led to inadequate public information and is hindering effective preventive education. The (hetero) sexualization - including the shift from drug use- and consequent feminization of the epidemic are familiar patterns. Since drug use and sex outside marriage are criminalized and their social stigma is higher for women, we should expect an already higher number of female HIV positivity than the registered statistics.<br />
  Marital sex is women’s primary risk factor. Condom use is not common practice among married couples and the current family planning policies are not encouraging condom use. Many married women don’t recognize themselves at risk or don’t have the knowledge of HIV/AIDS or access to testing services. Therefore, they constitute a major group of the undiagnosed cases. Furthermore, the fear of violence, abandonment and ostracization stops women from seeking testing or if diagnosed, treatment.<br />
   The construction of female sexuality that considers women’s bodies as men’s property, crystallized in legal codes such as tamkin, deprives women of the control over their sexual relations, renders women more vulnerable to sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS, and ultimately fuels the spread of the AIDS epidemic.<br />
  Television seems to be gradually acknowledging a female face for HIV/AIDS and    moving from a demonization to a victimization model in its representation of women who engage in sex out of marriage. AIDS is still portrayed as the disease of the sinner. <br />
   Although the gender inequality and poverty as the main drives of the epidemic cannot be eliminated by any short term agenda, some preventive measures can influence and slow down the transmission of HIV to certain extent. The following law and policy recommendations are crucial steps to be taken for halting the spread of the epidemic among women: </p>

<p>Legal reform:<br />
-Decriminalization of drug use, pre/extramarital sex and prostitution,<br />
- Reforming the law of “tamkin” that ideologically justifies women’s lack of control over their bodies in a marital bond.</p>

<p>Sexual education at schools:<br />
 Open, explicit discussion of safe sex. The current obscure, confusing and even wrong messages will not lead to any significant behavioral change among youth. </p>

<p>Changing family planning policies:<br />
 - More positive attitude towards condom use with an inclusion of men in the programs . <br />
-Sexual education for married women, emphasizing their risk of contracting the virus from their husbands. The infrastructures for this task, i.e. the widespread primary health care system especially in rural areas and the pre marriage counseling session, are already in place.<br />
-Providing a safe and confidential space where single women can receive sexual and reproductive health services (at present just offered to married women in public clinics) with trained staff with nonjudgmental attitude.</p>

<p>Drop in Centers for providing services to female drug users:<br />
These centers should be geographically situated in a way that women who frequent those buildings are not immediately recognized as drug users in the neighborhood.</p>
