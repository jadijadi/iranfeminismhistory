Soon after revolution the secular legal system in Iran shifted to a non-secular one. This system was based on fundamental understanding of Islam.<br />
So many discriminatory rules and punishment have been defined in this new system.<br />
She observed all these changes  and got more motivation to stand for Iranian women’s right.</p>

<p>She realized that this new established system would not be change overnight again.<br />
In spite of her non-religion background, she started to study Shari’a law to be able to make a dialogue with the legal system in their religious language.<br />
After a decade of silence, she started her writing again in a very conservative and soft way about women’s right under so much pressures and minimum of freedom of speech and thought.<br />
She was the first person who took this risk and talked about women’s right publicly after revolution in Iran.</p>

<p>With supporting the international human rights  organizations, she has been released under a huge bail.<br />
But soon after, she has been diagnosed with an aggressive breast cancer which was developed in jail.<br />
Medical team gave her hope of life only for couple of years.<br />
She got more energy to work. during her chemotherapy she wrote two valuable books about Women’s rights issues in Iran.<br />

<p><img alt="Picture11.jpg" src="http://herlandmag.net/Picture11.jpg" width="441" height="700" /></p>

After two months, her husband has been kidnapped in Iran. So, she could not go back again till now.<br />
She did not give up and started to work with Human Rights organizations and Universities in the States to promote women’s right in Iran.<br />
