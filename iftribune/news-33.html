      The ''Global Gag Rule''<br><br>The ''global gag rule'' is a policy of the United States government that<br>denies US family planning funding to foreign non-governmental organizations<br>that perform abortions, provide counselling and referral for abortion, or<br>lobby to make abortion legal or more widely available in their countries.<br>Officially known as the ''Mexico City Policy,'' it is nicknamed the ''gag<br>rule'' because it stifles free speech on abortion-related issues. [1] It was<br>reinstated by US President George W. Bush as soon as he was installed in<br>office in January 2001, and its reinstatement coincided with the<br>anniversary of the 1973 US Supreme Court Roe v. Wade decision, which<br>legalized abortion in the country.<br><br>In 2003, the US administration declared that the gag rule would not apply<br>to funds used for fighting HIV and AIDS. However, recent reports indicate<br>that the exception has been reversed in a new $193 million program in<br>Kenya. [2] <br><br>Women''s rights advocates have been pushing for a Millennium Development<br>Goal Fund that would address MDG-related issues of reproductive health and<br>gender empowerment. [3] The United States government, on the other hand,<br>sees calls for the protection of women''s reproductive health rights as a<br>veiled attempt to promote abortion and increase the procurement of<br>condoms.<br><br><br>Putting Ideology First<br><br>The global gag rule highlights the age-old struggle between ideology and<br>reality. The US administration believes in promoting abstinence from sex<br>outside marriage, and opposes a woman''s right to choose to have an<br>abortion. Realists argue that abstinence before marriage is rare, and that<br>abortion will go on, regardless of laws allowing or outlawing it. Whether<br>or not the gag rule applies to programs on HIV and AIDS, on the ground, it<br>has had tremendous repercussions on efforts to tackle the pandemic. In<br>Kenya, two of the most prominent and impactful reproductive health care<br>providers, Marie Stopes International and the Family Planning Association<br>of Kenya (FPAK) lost US funding after refusing to submit to the<br>restrictions of the gag rul. [4] These restrictions included even<br>discussing the toll of illegal, unsafe and unregulated abortions. As a<br>result, they have had to close clinics that were a vital reproductive<br>health life line in economically deprived areas that are densely populated<br>and underserved. They have also had to lay off staff and keep a skeleton of<br>overworked and underpaid staff. Inevitably, the clinics, renowned for their<br>affordable fees, have had to raise their prices, further restricting access<br>by poor people to quality reproductive health care. <br><br>It is well-recognized that HIV/AIDS has a disproportionate toll on women<br>and girls. Family planning service providers play a crucial role in the<br>fight against HIV and AIDS in several ways [5]:<br><br>- HIV/AIDS is a reproductive health issue. Seventy-five percent of all new<br>infections result from heterosexual transmission.<br>- Family planning service providers already target those who are most<br>vulnerable to infection, the youth and women, whose main, and often only,<br>entry point into the health system is through the services they provide.<br>- Family planning service providers are a primary source of contraceptives,<br>including condoms which are essential in tackling HIV and AIDS.<br>- There is a lot of stigma associated with stand-alone HIV/AIDS centres.<br>Family planning clinics are one-stop centres where women can access a wide<br>range of reproductive health services, including information on HIV and<br>AIDS.,<br>- Most family planning clinics are also voluntary testing and counselling<br>(VCT) centres and provide valuable information on how to avoid high-risk<br>behaviour, and how to live positively with the virus or the full blown<br>disease.<br>- Many family planning service providers are able to penetrate areas that<br>are otherwise underserved by health care providers.<br><br>The global gag rule has disrupted the crucial HIV/AIDS intervention role of<br>FPAK, Marie Stopes and numerous other organizations. Just as it is<br>impossible to separate family planning services from efforts to fight HIV<br>and AIDS, it is impossible to separate family planning services from<br>abortion-related issues. When an anti-abortion muzzle is put on<br>reproductive health providers, all the other beneficial seivices that they<br>provide are eroded. Without adequate access to contraception and<br>reproductive health care and education, the rate of both safe and unsafe<br>abortions will increase. Most family planning centres also have to deal<br>with the after-effects of underground, unsafe abortions.<br><br>Pretending that the war against HIV/AIDS will be won when sex takes place<br>within the confines of marriage is counterproductive, and restricting<br>funding solely to organizations that promote the myth is lethal. It will<br>result in a waste of money and the victory of HIV and AIDS.<br><br><br>--------- <br>Notes<br><br>1. http://www.globalgagrule.org<br>2.
