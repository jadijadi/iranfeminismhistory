      On the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women,<br>AWID interviews Muhammad Usman Ghani - Lawyer and Chairman of Survive<br>Welfare Organisation in Pakistan, where violence against women remains a<br>major concern.<br><br><br><br><br>AWID: Tell us about the work of Survive welfare Organization – how did the<br>organization evolve? What specific work is the organization doing? <br><br>Survive Welfare Organization (SWO) is a non government and non profit<br>organization working in Pakistan since May 04, 2004 with the sole object to<br>provide the basic necessities of life and to solve grievances. Specifically,<br>the SWO was established for the welfare and betterment of neglected women in<br>Pakistan deprived of their basic constitutional rights, and to provide women<br>with the basic necessities of life like education, health and protection.<br>SWO applies all its funds for the welfare and protection of women, and<br>works for the safety and protection of innocent women who are victims of<br>domestic violence, sexual assault, sexual harassment and those women who<br>have deserted from their houses. <br><br>SWO also provides free legal aid and legal advice to indigenous women who<br>can not afford expensive legal consulting for acquiring their legitimate<br>rights being encroached by a cruel society. The organization helps women to<br>register their cases with police so as to put the law in motion, and<br>similarly files civil / criminal suits in the court so as to protect and<br>preserve their rights.<br><br>SWO educates people about gender sensitive active non-violence and strives<br>to spread general awareness that there should be no discrimination among<br>global people especially due to their gender.<br><br>Finally, the SWO provides technical training to indigenous women by<br>providing them with free sewing machines so that in cases where the women<br>are sole bread winner of their family, they can afford the expenses of<br>their children and run their domestic affairs.<br><br><br>AWID: Domestic Violence is an issue of concern in Pakistan. Could you tell<br>us about the severity of domestic violence in Pakistan and how women are<br>currently protected by the Law and the judicial system, and are yet unable<br>to seek justice?<br><br><br>Every year hundreds of women of all ages in Pakistan are killed in the name<br>of Honour Killing. During the last year 1,261 cases of honour killing were<br>reported; honour killing and Karo-Kari is a custom of killing mostly women<br>who are accused of having sexual relations with strangers. Karo is when a<br>man is killed; Kari when a woman is killed.<br><br>In 2004, at least 43 acid attacks took place in Pakistan, with disputes<br>over matters of matrimony or domestic arguments appearing to be the most<br>common reason behind the acid attacks. About 14 acid attacks have occurred<br>in 2005, with this practice destroying the lives of hundreds of women in<br>Pakistan. Another brutal action of domestic violence in Pakistan is where a<br>newly married girl receives mental and physical torture by her in-laws, or<br>they kill her through the explosion of a clay stove and pretend it to be an<br>accident. Last year in Pakistan 7000 women were burnt in domestic violence<br>incidents. <br><br>Pakistani women are also victims of sexual assault and sexual harassment,<br>with thousands of women becoming victims of sexual assault. Unfortunately<br>these women are forced to compromise with the rapist because in the<br>Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) rape is a non compoundable offence and Judges and<br>local police compel the victim to compromise for a small amount of money due<br>to their poverty, without giving the rapist a sentence.<br><br>The victims of domestic violence are refused the right to register their<br>cases against the alleged accused, because police discourage the victims<br>family from seeking justice on the grounds that the legal expenses are too<br>high and often the accused are influential and have police protection.<br><br>As many as 44 countries have enacted legislation on domestic violence.<br>While Pakistan does not have specific legislation on it, there are sections<br>of the Pakistan Penal Code and other laws that can be used to invoke justice<br>for the victim, Still, domestic violence is not a crime against the state,<br>and no special laws in Pakistan has been drafted having special remedies<br>and procedures. Violence against women is perpetrated when legislation, law<br>enforcement and judicial systems condone or do not recognize domestic<br>violence as a crime<br><br>Women who attempt to report abuse encounter serious obstacles. Police tend<br>to respond to such reports by trying to reconcile with the concerned<br>parties rather than filing charges and arresting the perpetrators. Further<br>compounding the problem, the doctors who perform examinations are likely to<br>be skeptical to women’s claim of abuse.<br><br><br>AWID: Are these Laws enough for the protection of women and for seeking<br>justice for victims? What are the major flaws? What role do cultural<br>barriers play?<br><br>These Laws are not enough to meet the end of justice because as the two<br>authorities having the force of Law (police & court) are not enforcing<br>it, mere legislation on any Bill is not sufficient unless it is implemented<br>by the law enforcing agencies. Police who are supposed to stand guard of<br>life, honor & property of people are the first to violate the law<br>because they think that they are not accountable to any authority thus<br>misusing their power and duties. Police mostly support the version of the<br>accused party - they never favor innocent women to whom wrong has been done<br>but force the women and her family to patch up relations with the accused<br>and to withdraw both the FIR registered with police and the case pending in<br>court. Women are threatened with adverse consequences using threats &<br>intimidation to the victim discouraging them to seek justice with fear of<br>harm to their family, honor and property. <br><br>On the other side the court is sometimes reluctant to entertain the cases<br>of victims and to penalize the accused in accordance with Law. The major<br>reasonfor this is that judges are approached by the accused party, who are<br>often influential and rich, and so on these grounds the cases of victims<br>are dismissed. The other major flaw is that victims are poor and unable to<br>afford the legal expenses. For these reasons many victims can not claim any<br>relief from the court.<br><br>Cultural barriers do play a pivotal role in discouraging the victim from<br>recourse to Law because the families of victims think that if society comes<br>to know that any person has done wrong with their daughter, sister, wife or<br>mother they would be disgraced in the society & community and their<br>relatives would abandon relations with them. If they could not find any<br>suitable match for their women for marriages, people would taunt them and<br>would laugh on their helplessness - this is why the families of victims<br>prevent her from registering the case or filing any suit against the<br>accused and also want to avoid any media publication.<br><br><br>AWID: How are women mobilizing for change in Pakistan?<br><br>The media has played a vital role in mobilizing women for particular causes<br>like domestic violence & sexual harassment and assault. Those cases<br>which were not registered with police in their daily diary and those cases<br>which were pending in the court were all entertained in an expeditious<br>manner through the media as a result of women''s mobilization, highlighting<br>the government''s inefficiency and lack of concern regarding women''s human<br>rights. This has had an effective and fruitful result because the<br>government has issued directions to police & the court to work in<br>accordance with the Law and justice -  so many changes have been seen.<br><br>Women''s organizations have launched campaigns, demonstrations, protests and<br>marches through out the country with the support of electronic and print<br>media who transmit their voices to every nook and corner of Pakistan and as<br>well other parts of the world. This also shows consolidation between these<br>women''s organizations. The media has encouraged the women of Pakistan to<br>join hands with these Women''s organizations and to assemble for their<br>protection & safety. Thousands of women have joined these associations<br>and organizations which means that women of the country promote and<br>encourage women''s mobilization in Pakistan.<br><br><br>AWID: What urgent changes need to be made and how?<br><br><br>Government should constitute a council or a committee to monitor whether<br>there is any violation of women''s human rights in any part of the country.<br>They should take urgent action against any such authority or official who<br>causes a hindrance in the implementation and enforcement of law, and any<br>officer guilty of misconduct or misuse of power should be impeached and<br>given an exemplary punishment so that no government servant dares to<br>violate the Law with this perspective that he is not accountable to any<br>authority.<br><br>The government should promote and encourage the media with exclusive<br>liberty to work, focus and criticize any government policy which is<br>detrimental to Human Rights, and if any Bill has been passed in the<br>Legislature or any Enactment has been framed which is against Fundamental<br>Rights conferred by the Constitution of Pakistan 1973, it shall be declared<br>null and void. It should be revised and reconsidered before it is brought<br>into force.<br><br>One example here is the Honour Killing Bill which was passed by the<br>National Assembly of Pakistan and was completely against the fundamental<br>rights. Due to this legislation, thousands of women were killed for<br>different reasons and causes and later it was given the name of Honor<br>Killing so that the accused may not be punished in accordance with the Law.<br>It was a heinous offence committed at the national level being incorporated<br>by the legislation of the National Assembly. Such legislation had never<br>been framed in Pakistan''s history, although now this legislation has been<br>overruled - but many lives were lost due to this legislation.<br><br>For more information, contact Survive Welfare Organisation:<br>19-A Abbot Road, Lahore - Pakistan.<br>Ph/Fax:: 92-41-6301829<br>Email:  survive_welfareorganization@hotmail.com or<br>survive_welfareorganization@yahoo.com <br><br><br>  </font> </P></TD>
