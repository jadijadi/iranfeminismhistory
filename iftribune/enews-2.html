      Interview with Marianne Mollmann<br><br><br>Mujeres Autoconvocadas Rosario (MAR) is a local network of over forty<br>women''s organizations, NGOs, government representatives and individuals. On<br>Tuesday, November 15 in the city of Rosario, MAR invited the Danish jurist<br>Marianne Mollmann, a member of the Women''s Rights Division of Human Rights<br>Watch, to present her Research Paper: ''''Decisi√≥n prohibida: Acceso de las<br>mujeres a los anticonceptivos y al aborto en Argentina'''' - ''''Forbidden<br>Decision: Women''s access to contraceptives and abortion in Argentina.''''<br><br><br>AWID: Why was Argentina selected for this research?<br><br>M. M.: This problem is very prevalent throughout the region, but we<br>selected this country because it came to our attention that 40% of<br>pregnancies result in illegal abortions, as accessing a legal abortion is<br>practically impossible. In theory, the probability of accessing a legal<br>abortion is minimal, and only occurs if one''s life is in danger or the<br>woman''s health is at risk, or in the case of the raping of a mentally<br>disabled woman. The legal options are minimal.<br><br>According to Mollmann, these elevated percentages of pregnancies that<br>result in abortions are due to restrictions or failures in the health<br>system or the result of responsible procreation. It is not because women<br>decide - as she ironically stated - ''''to have seven abortions as a life<br>project.'''' <br><br>The research aimed at unveiling the current restrictions that violate the<br>right of a woman to freely decide over her own body and to access<br>information to be able to make the right decisions. <br><br>The report points out that ''''despite the adoption of a promising<br>reproductive health law, medical doctors and spouses continue to exercise<br>control over women''s reproductive health through political laws that<br>compromise women''s decision making, and place it in the hands of external<br>arbitrary interference. Domestic and sexual violence are constant<br>challenges for women wanting to access contraceptives. A significant number<br>of abusive men intentionally sabotage their wives'' or partner''s attempts to<br>access contraceptives as part of their abuse.   <br><br>Incorrect or tendentious information given by public health system workers<br>represents another challenge to women accessing contraceptives. In<br>addition, various women simply cannot afford to pay for contraceptive<br>methods, and government promises to subsidize them often do not reach those<br>most in need.  <br><br>Voluntary access to female sterilization -one of the most effective<br>contraceptive methods- is subject to arbitrary and discriminatory<br>restrictions by the government. Furthermore, some public health officers<br>demand that women provide legal authorization to be able to access<br>sterilization, even if they meet all the requirements, which violates their<br>rights.'''' <br><br>As a result of this research HRW has provided the Argentine State with a<br>series of recommendations that intend to solve and end women''s rights<br>violations as they are defined in the 1994 National Constitution.   <br><br>The recommendations are as follows:<br><br>- To ensure that women have access to comprehensive, accurate and timely<br>information.  <br>- To make available a wide range of contraceptive methods - including<br>sterilization.<br>- To guarantee the access to voluntary and safe abortion that cannot be<br>prosecuted through the Penal Code, and<br>- To ensure that women have access to humanitarian post-abortion care<br>without being afraid of any legal ramifications.<br>  <br><br>AWID: How do you see the Argentine situation in relation to the rest of<br>countries in the region?<br> <br>M. M.: Studies should be done in each country in order to compare and<br>provide an in-depth picture of actual access, compare legislation, but most<br>surprising to me is that in Argentina there is a lack of recognition of the<br>necessity of a secular state in order to really address these rights, which<br>are international rights. In contrast in Mexico, also a Catholic country, in<br>which the general population takes into account priests'' opinions, there<br>also exists indignation when it is felt that the church becomes too<br>involved in politics; there is a consciousness that state and church should<br>not be mixed. Politics is one thing, especially state politics, which should<br>follow universal guidelines that are separate from personal beliefs, and the<br>Church is something else. The Church has the right to say whatever it likes,<br>but it is recognized that it should remain separate, even among Catholics,<br>something that I have not seen in Argentina. I have not seen indignation in<br>the face of a state that incorporates one particular faith in its guidelines<br>for certain policies, and this is an obstacle for this kind of problem. <br><br>AWID: And abortion?<br><br>M.M.: As I have said, here women can access an abortion when their life or<br>health is threatened or in the case of rape of a mentally disabled woman.<br>This caught my attention as in other countries rape is sufficient to access<br>abortion without more explanations. It is as though it is to be made<br>absolutely clear that that woman did not have the possibility to consent to<br>having sexual relations; it has to do with the mentality that a woman, in<br>some way or another provoked or wanted, or showed interest in having sexual<br>relations, does not deserve in a future instance to have autonomy over her<br>body. It is a very important distinction which determines those that have<br>access to abortion, and those that do not.     <br><br><br><br>  </font> </P></TD>
