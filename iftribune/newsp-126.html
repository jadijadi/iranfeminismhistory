      On this March 8th, I declare my solidarity with my fellow Iranian sisters <br>and women all over the world subject to various forms of violence.  As I <br>write these words, I remember one incidence in particular showcasing the <br>general permissive attitude towards wife-beating greatly harming women in <br>Iran as in other corners of the world. <br><br>I went to "Pezeshki Ghanooni" this summer as part of a project to get a closer, <br>albeit brief, look into the issue of domestic violence in Iran.  There was a <br>male physician in the room, who was in fact the main facilitator for my entry <br>into this center.   After a few unrelated cases, a woman came in with a black <br>eye.  The doctor inquired about the person who had beaten her.  She <br>indicated that her husband was the culprit.  He asked if this was <br>his first time and heard a negative response.  Then he continued on, in his <br>confident and self-assured voice, "Well, I am sure that you yourself <br>provoked him."  I was shocked.  She was in fact being blamed for the <br>severe beating she had received.  I could not believe that I was hearing <br>this from a highly educated person, a physician supposedly trained to <br>treat women subjected to domestic violence, who are already in a highly <br>shattered psychological state.  All I could think was that he as well as <br>all other physicians encountering domestic violence survivors were in need <br>of some serious training on domestic violence issues.  If this was the <br>outlook of the supposedly sensitized physician, I did not even want to <br>imagine what reaction she would receive from the judge, most probably a <br>highly conservative male, when she attempted to seek redress.  The doctor <br>said, in a joking voice now, but still probably manifesting views held by <br>him and many others in the society, "Doesn't your husband have the right <br>to beat you?" As manifested by this rhetorical question and the positive <br>response he received, this kind of thinking seems to be very much <br>established, at least in social mores and commonly held beliefs. <br><br>May this March 8th and the project on violence against women be a <br>definitive start to the end of these attitudes. <br><br>In solidarity, Azadeh <br><ashahsha@umich.edu><br><br>  </font> </P></TD>
